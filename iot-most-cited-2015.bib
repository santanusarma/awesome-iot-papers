abstract={The combination of the Internet and emerging technologies such as nearfield communications, real-time localization, and embedded sensors lets us transform everyday objects into smart objects that can understand and react to their environment. Such objects are building blocks for the Internet of Things and enable novel computing applications. As a step toward design and architectural principles for smart objects, the authors introduce a hierarchy of architectures with increasing levels of real-world awareness and interactivity. In particular, they describe activity-, policy-, and process-aware smart objects and demonstrate how the respective architectural abstractions support increasingly complex application.},

abstract={The increasing usage of smart embedded devices in business blurs the line between the virtual and real worlds. This creates new opportunities to build applications that better integrate real-time state of the physical world, and hence, provides enterprise services that are highly dynamic, more diverse, and efficient. Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) approaches traditionally used to couple functionality of heavyweight corporate IT systems, are becoming applicable to embedded real-world devices, i.e., objects of the physical world that feature embedded processing and communication. In such infrastructures, composed of large numbers of networked, resource-limited devices, the discovery of services and on-demand provisioning of missing functionality is a significant challenge. We propose a process and a suitable system architecture that enables developers and business process designers to dynamically query, select, and use running instances of real-world services (i.e., services running on physical devices) or even deploy new ones on-demand, all in the context of composite, real-world business applications.},

These will form a distributed network with sensing capabilities that will allow unprecedented market opportunities, spurring new services, including energy monitoring and control of homes, buildings, industrial processes and so forth. In this paper, we concentrate on the actual implementation of the communication technology, adopting the Representational State Transfer (REST) approach. REST only relies on the HTTP methods such as GET and POST. Embedded communication devices are addressed using Universal Resource Indicators (URI) and data is exchanged through standard XML. We present our TinyOS design and implementation of two components that will play a fundamental role in the communication stack of REST-based devices. First, we focus on the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), which allows REST--based communications among applications residing in distributed and networked embedded systems. Second, we present our lightweight implementation of a EXI library: an efficient binary compressor for XML data files. Experimental results are provided in terms of compression, decoding (EXI) and access time (CoAP) performance.},

Following the definition of a possible social structure among objects, a preliminary architecture for the implementation of SIoT is presented. Through the SIoT paradigm, the capability of humans and devices to discover, select, and use objects with their services in the IoT is augmented. Besides, a level of trustworthiness is enabled to steer the interaction among the billions of objects which will crowd the future IoT.},

An increase in research efforts has led to maturity in this field, yet there seem to be gaps to be filled because of the focus on how to adapt the IP to the space of things. This article introduces the Sensor Networks for an All-IP World (SNAIL) approach to the IoT. The proposed architecture includes a complete IP adaptation method. It also includes four significant network protocols: mobility, web enablement, time synchronization, and security. The feasibility and interoperability of the proposed approach is confirmed by the implementation of SNAIL platforms and tests on a testbed built in the Korea Advanced Research Network.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is the logical further development of today's Internet. Technological advancements lead to smart objects being capable of identifying, locating, sensing and connecting and thus leading to new forms of communication between people and things and things themselves. Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) encompasses technical systems to support elderly people in their daily routine to allow an independent and safe lifestyle as long as possible. Keep In Touch (KIT) uses smart objects and technologies (Near Field Communication and Radio Frequency Identification) to facilitate telemonitoring processes. Closed Loop Healthcare Services take use of KIT technology and are capable of processing relevant data and establishing communication channels between elderly people and their environment and different groups of care-givers (physicians, relatives, mobile care providers). The combination of KIT technology (smart objects) and Closed Loop Healthcare Services results in an applied IoT infrastructure for AAL scenarios. Already applied IoT and AAL applications in telemonitoring and medication intake compliance projects show that these applications are useful and accepted by the elderly and that the developed infrastructure enables a new form of communication between people and people, people-to-people (P2P) communication. The personal communication between elderly people, their environment and relevant groups of care givers is an important aspect in AAL. Through the combination of KIT and Closed Loop Healthcare, a central AAL paradigm can be realized through the IoT, where the elderly live in their homes with smart objects, thus smart homes, communicating to the outside world in an intelligent and goal-orientated manner.},

As a single global standard for all device types and application domains is impracticable, we propose an architecture where the infrastructure is agnostic of applications and application development is fully decoupled from the embedded domain. In our design, the application logic of devices is running on application servers, while thin servers embedded into devices export only their elementary functionality using REST resources. In this paper, we present our design goals and preliminary results of this approach, featuring the Californium (Cf) CoAP framework.},

abstract={From a semantic analysis for Internet of things, a conclusion is drawn that the word thing here indicates actually the thing's information and the Internet here is actually the Internet application. Internet of Things is a new type of Internet application which makes the thing's information be shared on a global scale. Internet of Things has two attributes: being an Internet application and dealing with thing's information, and four differential features: only for thing's information, coded by UID or EPC, stored in RFID electronic tag, uploaded by non-contact reading with RFID reader. The descriptive models for Internet of Things are introduced based on the basic attributes and the differential features. The graphical model of Internet of Things shows that the two main tasks of constructing Internet of Things are the preprocessing of thing's information before uploaded into Internet and the building of a RFID system. The set expression model of Internet of Things stresses the common character all Internet applications have (namely an Internet application is essentially a set of information), so the development processes and the technical methods of other Internet applications could be referenced and reused for building Internet of Things.},

However, with the widespread deployment of networked, intelligent sensor technologies, an Internet of Things (IoT) is steadily evolving, much like the Internet decades ago. In the future, hundreds of billions of smart sensors and devices will interact with one another without human intervention, on a Machine-to-Machine (M2M) basis. They will generate an enormous amount of data at an unprecedented scale and resolution, providing humans with information and control of events and objects even in remote physical environments. The scale of the M2M Internet will be several orders of magnitude larger than the existing Internet, posing serious research challenges. This paper will provide an overview of challenges and opportunities presented by this new paradigm.},

abstract={The Internet is a living entity, always changing and evolving. New applications and businesses are created continuously. In addition to an evolving Internet, technology is also changing the landscape. Broadband connectivity is becoming cheap and ubiquitous; devices are becoming more powerful and smaller with a variety of on-board sensors. The proliferation of more devices becoming connected is leading to a new paradigm: the Internet of Things. The Internet of Things is driven by an expansion of the Internet through the inclusion of physical objects combined with an ability to provide smarter services to the environment as more data becomes available. Various application domains ranging from Green-IT and energy efficiency to logistics are already starting to benefit from Internet of Things concepts. There are challenges associated with the Internet of Things, most explicitly in areas of trust and security, standardisation and governance required to ensure a fair and trustworthy open Internet of Things which provides value to all of society. Internet of Things is high on the research agenda of several multinationals as well as the European Commission and countries such as China. The research conducted is driving the creation of a useful and powerful Internet of Things. The benefits of Internet of Things to the developing and emerging economies are significant, and strategies to realise these need to be found.},

abstract={Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are playing more and more a key role in several application scenarios such as healthcare, agriculture, environment monitoring, and smart metering. Furthermore, WSNs are characterized by high heterogeneity because there are many different proprietary and non-proprietary solutions. This wide range of technologies has delayed new deployments and integration with existing sensor networks. The current trend, however, is to move away from proprietary and closed standards, to embrace IP-based sensor networks using the emerging standard 6LoWPAN/IPv6. This allows native connectivity between WSN and Internet, enabling smart objects to participate to the Internet of Things (IoT). Building an all-IP infrastructure from scratch, however, would be difficult because many different sensors and actuators technologies (both wired and wireless) have already been deployed over the years. After a review of the state of the art, this paper sketches a framework able to harmonize legacy and new installations, allowing migrating to an all-IP environment at a later stage. The Building Automation use case has been chosen to discuss potential benefits of the proposed framework.},

abstract={The emerging compressed sensing (CS) theory can significantly reduce the number of sampling points that directly corresponds to the volume of data collected, which means that part of the redundant data is never acquired. It makes it possible to create standalone and net-centric applications with fewer resources required in Internet of Things (IoT). CS-based signal and information acquisition/compression paradigm combines the nonlinear reconstruction algorithm and random sampling on a sparse basis that provides a promising approach to compress signal and data in information systems. This paper investigates how CS can provide new insights into data sampling and acquisition in wireless sensor networks and IoT. First, we briefly introduce the CS theory with respect to the sampling and transmission coordination during the network lifetime through providing a compressed sampling process with low computation costs. Then, a CS-based framework is proposed for IoT, in which the end nodes measure, transmit, and store the sampled data in the framework. Then, an efficient cluster-sparse reconstruction algorithm is proposed for in-network compression aiming at more accurate data reconstruction and lower energy efficiency. Performance is evaluated with respect to network size using datasets acquired by a real-life deployment.},

abstract={We have witnessed the Fixed Internet emerging with virtually every computer being connected today; we are currently witnessing the emergence of the Mobile Internet with the exponential explosion of smart phones, tablets and net-books. However, both will be dwarfed by the anticipated emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT), in which everyday objects are able to connect to the Internet, tweet or be queried. Whilst the impact onto economies and societies around the world is undisputed, the technologies facilitating such a ubiquitous connectivity have struggled so far and only recently commenced to take shape. To this end, this paper introduces in a timely manner and for the first time the wireless communications stack the industry believes to meet the important criteria of power-efficiency, reliability and Internet connectivity. Industrial applications have been the early adopters of this stack, which has become the de-facto standard, thereby bootstrapping early IoT developments with already thousands of wireless nodes deployed. Corroborated throughout this paper and by emerging industry alliances, we believe that a standardized approach, using latest developments in the IEEE 802.15.4 and IETF working groups, is the only way forward. We introduce and relate key embodiments of the power-efficient IEEE 802.15.4-2006 PHY layer, the power-saving and reliable IEEE 802.15.4e MAC layer, the IETF 6LoWPAN adaptation layer enabling universal Internet connectivity, the IETF ROLL routing protocol enabling availability, and finally the IETF CoAP enabling seamless transport and support of Internet applications. The protocol stack proposed in the present work converges towards the standardized notations of the ISO/OSI and TCP/IP stacks. What thus seemed impossible some years back, i.e., building a clearly defined, standards-compliant and Internet-compliant stack given the extreme restrictions of IoT networks, is commencing to become reality.},

In this paper, we focus specifically to an urban IoT system that, while still being quite a broad category, are characterized by their specific application domain. Urban IoTs, in fact, are designed to support the Smart City vision, which aims at exploiting the most advanced communication technologies to support added-value services for the administration of the city and for the citizens. This paper hence provides a comprehensive survey of the enabling technologies, protocols, and architecture for an urban IoT.

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) enables a wide range of application scenarios with potentially critical actuating and sensing tasks, e.g., in the e-health domain. For communication at the application layer, resource-constrained devices are expected to employ the constrained application protocol (CoAP) that is currently being standardized at the Internet Engineering Task Force. To protect the transmission of sensitive information, secure CoAP mandates the use of datagram transport layer security (DTLS) as the underlying security protocol for authenticated and confidential communication. DTLS, however, was originally designed for comparably powerful devices that are interconnected via reliable, high-bandwidth links. In this paper, we present Lithe-an integration of DTLS and CoAP for the IoT. With Lithe, we additionally propose a novel DTLS header compression scheme that aims to significantly reduce the energy consumption by leveraging the 6LoWPAN standard. Most importantly, our proposed DTLS header compression scheme does not compromise the end-to-end security properties provided by DTLS. Simultaneously, it considerably reduces the number of transmitted bytes while maintaining DTLS standard compliance. We evaluate our approach based on a DTLS implementation for the Contiki operating system. Our evaluation results show significant gains in terms of packet size, energy consumption, processing time, and network-wide response times when compressed DTLS is enabled.},

The framework uses the sensor-as-a-service notion to expose IoT cloud's connected objects functional aspects in the form of web services. The framework uses an adapter oriented approach to address the issue of connectivity with various types of sensor nodes. We employ semantic enhanced access polices to ensure that only authorized parties can access the IoT framework services, which result in enhancing overall security of the proposed framework. Furthermore, the use of event-driven service oriented architecture (e-SOA) paradigm assists the framework to leverage the monitoring process by dynamically sensing and responding to different connected objects sensor events. We present our design principles, implementations, and demonstrate the development of IoT application with reasoning capability by using a green school motorcycle (GSMC) case study. Our exploration shows that amalgamation of e-SOA, semantic web technologies and virtualization paves the way to address the connectivity, security and monitoring issues of IoT domain.},

Market research has shown a significant growth of sensor deployments over the past decade and has predicted a significant increment of the growth rate in the future. These sensors continuously generate enormous amounts of data. However, in order to add value to raw sensor data we need to understand it. Collection, modelling, reasoning, and distribution of context in relation to sensor data plays critical role in this challenge. Context-aware computing has proven to be successful in understanding sensor data. In this paper, we survey context awareness from an IoT perspective. We present the necessary background by introducing the IoT paradigm and context-aware fundamentals at the beginning. Then we provide an in-depth analysis of context life cycle. We evaluate a subset of projects (50) which represent the majority of research and commercial solutions proposed in the field of context-aware computing conducted over the last decade (2001-2011) based on our own taxonomy. Finally, based on our evaluation, we highlight the lessons to be learnt from the past and some possible directions for future research. The survey addresses a broad range of techniques, methods, models, functionalities, systems, applications, and middleware solutions related to context awareness and IoT. Our goal is not only to analyse, compare and consolidate past research work but also to appreciate their findings and discuss their applicability towards the IoT.},

In this paper we propose an application layer solution for interoperability. The key idea is to utilize device semantics provided by existing specifications and dynamically wrap them in our middleware into semantic services. Next, with the help of Semantic Web technologies, users can create and then execute complex tasks involving multiple heterogeneous devices. We demonstrate how our framework automates interoperability without any modifications to existing standards, devices, or technologies, while providing to the user an intuitive semantic interface with services that can be executed by combining devices in the network.},

Hence, it will be challenging to find enough experts to provide software for the vast number of expected devices, which must also be scalable and particularly safe due to the connection to the physical world. To remedy this situation, we propose an architecture that provides Web-like scripting for low-end devices through Cloud-based application servers and a consistent, RESTful programming model. Our novel runtime container Actinium (Ac) exposes scripts, their configuration, and their lifecycle management through a fully RESTful programming interface using the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP). We endow the JavaScript language with an API for direct interaction with mote-class IoT devices, the CoapRequest object, and means to export script data as Web resources. With Actinium, applications can be created by simply mashing up resources provided by CoAP servers on devices, other scripts, and classic Web services. We also discuss security considerations and show the suitability of this architecture in terms of performance with our publicly available implementation.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) many be thought of as the availability of physical objects, or devices, on the Internet [1]. Given such an arrangement it is possible to access sensor data and control actuators remotely. Furthermore such data may be combined with data from other sources - e.g. with data that is contained in the Web - or operated on by cloud based services to create applications far richer than can be provided by isolated embedded systems [2,3]. This is the vision of the Internet of Things. We present a cloud-compatible open source controller and an extensible API, hereafter referred to as `IoTCloud', which enables developers to create scalable high performance IoT and sensor-centric applications. The IoTCloud software is written in Java and built on popular open source packages such as Apache Active MQ [4] and JBoss Netty [5]. We present an overview of the IoT Cloud architecture and describe its developer API. Next we introduce the FutureGrid - a geographically distributed and heterogeneous cloud test-bed [6,7] - used in our experiments. Our preliminary results indicate that a distributed cloud infrastructure like the FutureGrid coupled with our flexible IoTCloud framework is an environment suitable for the study and development of IoT and sensor-centric applications. We also report on our initial study of certain measured characteristics of an IoTCloud application running on the FutureGrid. We conclude by inviting interested parties to use the IoTCloud to create their own IoT applications or contribute to its further development.},

The growth of the Internet shows no signs of slowing down and it steadily becomes the cause of a new pervasive paradigm in computing and communications. This new paradigm enhances the traditional Internet into a smart Internet of Things (IoT) created around intelligent interconnections of diverse objects in the physical world, such as vehicles, cell phones, habitats, and habitat occupants. It utilizes low-cost information gathering and dissemination devices, such as sensors and RFID tags, that facilitate fast-paced interactions among the objects themselves as well as the objects and persons in any place and at any time. IoT will usher in a wide range of smart applications and services to cope with many of the challenges individuals and organizations face in their everyday lives. For example, remote healthcare monitoring systems could aid in managing costs and alleviating the shortage of healthcare personnel; intelligent transportation systems could aid in reducing traffic congestion and inevitably the ills caused by it such as air pollution; smart distribution systems from utility grids to supply chains could aid in improving the quality and reducing the cost of their respective goods and services; tagged objects could result in more systematic recycling and effective waste disposal, and so on.},

Market research has shown a significant growth of sensor deployments over the past decade and has predicted a substantial acceleration of the growth rate in the future. It is also evident that the increasing number of IoT middleware solutions are developed in both research and commercial environments. However, sensor search and selection remain a critical requirement and a challenge. In this paper, we present CASSARAM, a context-aware sensor search, selection, and ranking model for Internet of Things to address the research challenges of selecting sensors when large numbers of sensors with overlapping and sometimes redundant functionality are available. CASSARAM proposes the search and selection of sensors based on user priorities. CASSARAM considers a broad range of characteristics of sensors for search such as reliability, accuracy, battery life just to name a few. Our approach utilises both semantic querying and quantitative reasoning techniques. User priority based weighted Euclidean distance comparison in multidimensional space technique is used to index and rank sensors. Our objectives are to highlight the importance of sensor search in IoT paradigm, identify important characteristics of both sensors and data acquisition processes which help to select sensors, understand how semantic and statistical reasoning can be combined together to address this problem in an efficient manner. We developed a tool called CASSARA to evaluate the proposed model in terms of resource consumption and response time.},

abstract={Deriving the critical density to achieve region coverage for random sensor deployment is a fundamentally important problem in the area of Internet of Things (IoT). Most of the existing works on sensor coverage mainly concentrate on the full coverage models, which ensure that all points in the deployment region are covered at the expense of high complexity and cost. In contrast, many applications of IoT focus on the exposure-path prevention, which does not require full coverage sensor deployment, and instead it only needs the partial coverage, because the exposure paths are prevented as long as no moving objects or phenomena can go through a deployment region without being detected. Finally, we focus on the partial coverage by applying the percolation theory to solve the exposure path problem for the network of sensors in IoT. Most of the existing percolation-based schemes apply the continuum-percolation theory, which, however, suffers from the loose lower and upper bounds on the critical density. To overcome this problem, we propose a bond-percolation theory based scheme by mapping the exposure path problem into a bond percolation model. Using this model, we derive the critical densities for both omnidirectional sensor networks and directional sensor networks under random sensor deployment where sensors are deployed according to a two-dimensional Poisson process. The rigorous modeling/analyses and extensive simulations show that our proposed scheme can yield much tighter upper and lower bounds on the critical densities as compared with those generated by continuum-percolation.},

abstract={With the design of data communications in mind, 3GPP LTE-advanced (LTE-A) is probably the most promising technology for Internet of Things (IoT). For IoT applications, continuous low-rate streaming data may be reported from devices over a long period of time, imposing stringent requirements on power saving. To manage power consumption, 3GPP LTE-A has defined the discontinuous reception/transmission (DRX/DTX) mechanism to allow devices to turn off their radio interfaces and go to sleep in various patterns. Existing literature has paid much attention to evaluate the performance of DRX/DTX; however, how to tune DRX/DTX parameters to optimize energy cost is still left open. This paper addresses the DRX/DTX optimization, by asking how to maximize the sleep periods of devices while guarantee their quality-of-service (QoS), especially on the aspects of traffic bit-rate, packet delay, and packet loss rate in IoT applications. Efficient schemes to optimize DRX/DTX parameters and schedule devices' packets with the base station are proposed. The key idea of our schemes is to balance the impacts between QoS parameters and DRX/DTX configurations. Simulation results show that our schemes can guarantee traffic bit-rate, packet delay, and packet loss rate while save energy of user equipments .},

We particularly focused on a ZigBee network as it can collect the latest information about `Things'. The EPC Network provides certain static information about `Things' such as name and manufacturer. To support end-to-end communication between sensor nodes and applications, Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) instead of Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) over ZigBee is developed. A gateway on a local area network converts HTTP and CoAP. A pseudo Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) protocol supports JOIN/LEAVE management of sensor nodes. We also prove a prototype home appliances management system that adopt our architecture over a ZigBee network.

The objective of information and communication technologies (ICT) is to focus on the new technologies the medical environments, so that it can provide management to accelerate and improve the clinical process. Our contribution is to introduce an approach based on Internet of things (IoT) in medical environments to achieve a global connectivity with the patient, sensors and everything around it. The main goal of this globality feature is to provide a context awareness to make the patient's life easier and the clinical process more effective. To achieve this approach, firstly has been developed an architecture which has been designed to offer great potential and flexibility of communications, monitoring and control. This architecture includes several advanced communication technologies; among them are 6LoWPAN and RFID/NFC, which are the basis of the IoT. Moreover the research deal with the problems related to the mobility and security that happens when IoT is applied in medical environments. The mobility issue requires developing a protocol over 6LoWPAN network to be carried out in sensor networks with high specification related with low power consumption and capacity. While in the RFID/NFC technologies need to support secure communications, our proposal is to introduce a set of security techniques and cryptographic SIM card to authenticate, encrypt and sign the communications with medical devices. The preliminary results showed a reduction of time in the handover process with the protocol for mobility defined, by omitting the stages of addressing and simplifying the MIPv6 protocol. In addition to increase the security in the communications carried out by NFC devices enhanced with the inclusion of cryptographic SIM card.},

The benefits are those of improving scalability in information/service discovery when the SIoT is made of huge numbers of heterogeneous nodes, similarly to what happens with social networks among humans. In this paper we focus on the problem of understanding how the information provided by the other members of the SIoT has to be processed so as to build a reliable system on the basis of the behavior of the objects. We define a subjective model for the management of trustworthiness which builds upon the solutions proposed for P2P networks. Each node computes the trustworthiness of its friends on the basis of its own experience and on the opinion of the common friends with the potential service providers. We employ a feedback system and we combine the credibility and centrality of the nodes to evaluate the trust level. Preliminary simulations show the benefits of the proposed model towards the isolation of almost any malicious node in the network.},

abstract={Despite recent advances in the IoT area for developing control systems into the cloud, the proliferation of inter-connected entities and the collection of diverse information act as the big challenges in order to provide full control over IoT devices. Solutions to the problem of formulating and managing internet-connected objects in cloud environments i.e. environments comprising ""entities"" and resources (such as sensors, actuators and smart devices) in cloud infrastructures are still in their infancy. This paper formulates design principles for IoT cloud environments and introduces a framework for the converging utility-driven cloud-based computing models, with emerging Internet-of-Things (IoT) infrastructures and applications into the cloud. Following results from analyzing the state-of-the-art and efforts towards the convergence of cloud computing and IoT, this paper also presents the main building blocks of a framework, which emphasizes on-demand establishment of IoT services based on the automated formulation of societies of internet-connected objects. The framework leverages well-known technologies (i.e. Linked Sensor Data) and standards (notably the W3C Semantic Sensor Networks ontology and the IETF COAP protocol).},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) will connect billions of sensors deployed around the world together. This will create an ideal opportunity to build a sensing-as-a-service platform. Due to large number of sensor deployments, there would be number of sensors that can be used to sense and collect similar information. Further, due to advances in sensor hardware technology, new methods and measurements will be introduced continuously. In the IoT paradigm, selecting the most appropriate sensors which can provide relevant sensor data to address the problems at hand among billions of possibilities would be a challenge for both technical and non-technical users. In this paper, we propose the Context Awareness for Internet of Things (CA4IOT) architecture to help users by automating the task of selecting the sensors according to the problems/tasks at hand. We focus on automated configuration of filtering, fusion and reasoning mechanisms that can be applied to the collected sensor data streams using selected sensors. Our objective is to allow the users to submit their problems, so our proposed architecture understands them and produces more comprehensive and meaningful information than the raw sensor data streams generated by individual sensors.},

Through Internet Protocol (IP) connectivity, devices can now be connected to the Internet, thus allowing them to be read, controlled, and managed at any time and at any place. Security is an important aspect for IoT deployments. However, proprietary security solutions do not help in formulating a coherent security vision to enable IoT devices to securely communicate with each other in an interoperable manner. This paper gives an overview of the efforts in the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to standardize security solutions for the IoT ecosystem. We first provide an in-depth review of the communication security solutions for IoT, specifically the standard security protocols to be used in conjunction with the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), an application protocol specifically tailored to the needs of adapting to the constraints of IoT devices. Since Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) has been chosen as the channel security underneath CoAP, this paper also discusses the latest standardization efforts to adapt and enhance the DTLS for IoT applications. This includes the use of 1) raw public key in DTLS; 2) extending DTLS record Layer to protect group (multicast) communication; and 3) profiling DTLS for reducing the size and complexity of implementations on embedded devices. We also provide an extensive review of compression schemes that are being proposed in IETF to mitigate message fragmentation issues in DTLS.},

Ubiquitous service provisioning depends on interoperability, not only for provisioning of a standard QoS controlled IP bearer, but also for cross domain naming, security, mobility, multicast, location, routing and management, including fair compensation for utility provisioning.

abstract={The vision of the Internet of Things is a seamless integration of diverse physical objects in the Internet through a virtual representation. In recent years, the target area of IoT constantly broadened from products within supply chains and nowadays encompasses all objects that are summarized under the label of ubiquitous and pervasive computing. Therefore also building automation devices are considered for an integration in the IoT, where they are for example used to realize a smart and sustainable building operation. Ubiquitous access to the objects is facilitated by the concept of building automation systems (BAS) that already provide a virtual representation of physical objects, mainly sensors, actuators and control devices. In practice, BAS follow a layered system architecture which defines a management, an automation and a field tier. In the field tier, non-IP communication based on twisted pair, power line or radio frequency technologies is prevalent. For the backbone infrastructure at the automation and management tier, IPv4 has become the de-facto standard. At this level, the transition towards IPv6 is the most promising technology to enable the full realization of the Internet of Things vision. New features like the larger address space, self-configuration, quality of service mechanisms and security promise a better integration of building automation technology in the IoT. Therefore this article investigates the readiness and compatibility of existing BAS technologies with IPv6. The integration challenges and new opportunities of IPv6 for these technologies are presented. Furthermore, possible integration scenarios for IPv6 using BAC net as example use case are sketched.},

In this article, we intend to present the IoT from the human-centric perspective. By analyzing the tight-coupled relationship between human and opportunistic connection of smart things (e.g., mobile phones, vehicles), we propose Opportunistic IoT. It enables information sharing and dissemination within/among opportunistic communities that are formed with the movement and opportunistic contact nature of human. We characterize the bi-directional effect between human and opportunistic IoT, present the innovative application areas, and discuss the challenges raised by this new computing paradigm.},

One of the key challenges is to integrate devices into business process. SOA is an ideal infrastructure for business process management as applications are invoked using standard interfaces and protocols. It's convenient to use device-oriented web services (doWS) to encapsulate devices functions. A doWS may conflict with other doWS because devices can't be controlled by more than one client at the same time. This brings additional complexity to web service composition. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive device collaboration model to doWS choreography. This model includes device layer, doWS layer, compatible resource layer and process layer, where device layer represent devices, doWS layer encapsulates devices functions, compatible resource layer abstracts compatible device operations as resource and avoid of conflict, process layer describes the collaboration process. Analysis shows that, this model can integrate devices with Web Services, and can achieve the conflict detection of doWS. This model is effective in the Internet of things.},

So far, the IP-based Internet is the largest network in the world; therefore, there are great strides to connect WSNs with the Internet. To this end, the IETF has developed a suite of protocols and open standards for accessing applications and services for wireless resource constrained networks. However, many open challenges remain, mostly due to the complex deployment characteristics of such systems and the stringent requirements imposed by various services wishing to make use of such complex systems. Thus, it becomes critically important to study how the current approaches to standardization in this area can be improved, and at the same time better understand the opportunities for the research community to contribute to the IoT field.

Wireless communications, which is an integral part of IoT, suffers from radio irregularity - a phenomenon referring to radio waves being selectively absorbed, reflected or scattered by objects in their paths, e.g., human bodies that comprises liquid, bone and flesh. Radio irregularity is often regarded as a problem in wireless communications but, with the envisioned pervasiveness of IoT, we aim to exploit radio irregularity as a means to detect people. We demonstrate how radio signal fluctuations arising from radio irregularity can be used to provide a low-cost alternative to dedicated sensing systems for indoor automated people counting.},

abstract={This visionary paper presents the Internet of Things paradigm in terms of interdependent dynamic dimensions of objects and their properties. Given that in its current state Internet of Things (IoT) has been viewed as a paradigm based on hierarchical distribution of objects, evaluation of the dynamic nature of the hierarchical structures faces challenges in its evaluation and analysis. Within this in mind, our focus is on the area of complex social networks and the dynamic social network construction within the context of IoT. This is by highlighting and addressing the tagging issues of the objects to the real-world domain such as in disaster management, these are in relation to their hierarchies and interrelation within the context of social network analysis. Specifically, we suggest to investigate and deepen the understanding of the IoT paradigm through the application of social network analysis as a method for interlinking objects -- and thus, propose ways in which IoT could be subsequently interlinked and analyzed through social network analysis approach - which provides possibilities for linking of the objects, while extends it into real-world domain. With this in mind, we present few applications and key characteristics of disaster management and the social networking analysis approach, as well as, foreseen benefits of its application in the IoT domain.},

Together with the conventional security solutions, the paper highlights the need to provide in-built security in the device itself to provide a flexible infrastructure for dynamic prevention, detection, diagnosis, isolation, and countermeasures against successful breaches. Based on this survey and analysis, the paper defines the security needs taking into account computational time, energy consumption and memory requirements of the devices.

A major step forward is decoupling the name of an object (identifier) from its physical location (locator), which are both expressed by the IP address currently. We argue that additional advantages can be brought if context metadata are provided along with the locator, thus forming an enriched locator. In this work, we propose an efficient architecture that allows the enriched locators to be distributed efficiently and in a scalable manner. The distribution protocol exploits the multiple Distributed Hash Table concept, which is well established in peer-to-peer overlays. Preliminary evaluation results obtained with a practical testbed implemented are reported.},

Interconnecting such resource constrained devices with high-performance machines requires new security mechanisms that cannot be covered by already known solutions. This paper describes attacks at transport layer against the LLN launched from the Internet. It also introduces approaches to ensure E2E security between two devices located in homogeneous networks using either HTTP/TLS or CoAP/DTLS by proposing a mapping between TLS and DTLS.},

Such proposals address the design of conceptual (and software) platforms, which can be exploited to easily develop and implement complex applications that require direct interactions among objects. The major goal is to build techniques that allow the network to enhance the level of trust between objects that are ""friends"" with each other. Furthermore, a social paradigm could definitely guarantee network navigability even if the number of nodes becomes orders of magnitude higher than in the traditional Internet.

A sustainable deployment of such a large number of electronic systems needs to be addressed with a Design-for-the-Environment approach. This requires minimizing 1) the embodied energy and carbon footprint of the WSN production, 2) the ecotoxicity of the WSN e-waste, and 3) the Internet traffic associated to the generated data. In this paper, we study how ultra-low-power yet high-performance systems-on-a-chip (SoCs) in nanometer CMOS technologies can contribute to these objectives by allowing compact batteryless WSNs with on-node data processing. We then review latest results achieved at the Universite’ catholique de Louvain in the field of green SoC design for a massive yet sustainable deployment of the IoT.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is part of Future Internet and will comprise many billions of Internet Connected Objects (ICO) or `things' where things can sense, communicate, compute and potentially actuate as well as have intelligence, multi-modal interfaces, physical/ virtual identities and attributes. Collecting data from these objects is an important task as it allows software systems to understand the environment better. Many different hardware devices may involve in the process of collecting and uploading sensor data to the cloud where complex processing can occur. Further, we cannot expect all these objects to be connected to the computers due to technical and economical reasons. Therefore, we should be able to utilize resource constrained devices to collect data from these ICOs. On the other hand, it is critical to process the collected sensor data before sending them to the cloud to make sure the sustainability of the infrastructure due to energy constraints. This requires to move the sensor data processing tasks towards the resource constrained computational devices (e.g. mobile phones). In this paper, we propose Mobile Sensor Data Processing Engine (MOSDEN), an plug-in-based IoT middleware for mobile devices, that allows to collect and process sensor data without programming efforts. Our architecture also supports sensing as a service model. We present the results of the evaluations that demonstrate its suitability towards real world deployments. Our proposed middleware is built on Android platform.},

Likewise the IoT can provide an useful tool for the longitudinal observation of human behavior and the understanding of behavioral patterns that can inform further IoT technology design. Today experimentation with IoT technologies is predominately carried out in lab based testbeds. There is however an emerging need for increased realism of the experimentation environment, as well as involvement of real end users into the experimentation lifecycle. In this paper we present SmartCampus, a user centric experimental research facility for IoT technologies. The current testbed deployment is focused on Smart Buildings, a key building block for cities of the future. Unlike current lab based testbeds, SmartCampus deeply embeds heterogeneous IoT devices as a programmable experimentation substrate in a real life office environment and makes flexible experimentation with real end users possible. We present the architecture realization of the current facility and underlying considerations that motivated its design. Using several recent experimental use cases, we demonstrate the usefulness of such experimental facilities for user-centric IoT research.},

Such enormous number of devices connected to internet provides many kinds of services and produce huge amount of data and information. Cloud computing is a model for on-demand access to a shared pool of configurable resources (e.g. compute, networks, servers, storage, applications, services, and software) that can be easily provisioned as Infrastructure (IaaS), software and applications (SaaS). Cloud based platforms help to connect to the things (IaaS) around us so that we can access anything at any time and any place in a user friendly manner using customized portals and in built applications (SaaS). Hence, cloud acts as a front end to access Internet of Things. Applications that interact with devices like sensors have special requirements of massive storage to storage big data, huge computation power to enable the real time processing of the data, and high speed network to stream audio or video. In this paper, we describe how Internet of Things and Cloud computing can work together can address the Big Data issues. We also illustrate about Sensing as a service on cloud using few applications like Augmented Reality, Agriculture and Environment monitoring.

A Discovery Service (DS) is responsible for collecting all these database URIs and feeding them to clients that query about an object. DSs are usually centralized and are designed to effectively aggregate as many information sources as possible, rather than trying to respond optimally to unforeseen user queries. In this paper we propose a novel, Information-Centric Networking (ICN) inspired, architecture that eliminates the need for a separate DS, enabling at the same time multi-ownership and flexible management of information that is associated with an object. In our ICN approach, information about an object is organized in scopes. Each scope has its own access control rules allowing easy control of information dissemination. Moreover scopes can be hierarchically organized, creating complex access structures that can reflect business relationships. In our architecture companies provide information about an object to the appropriate scopes, but they never lose control of this information. To access information associated with an object,a user queries the scope that corresponds to the desired context, which will forward the query to a service that will respond with the appropriate data. The query will not reveal any extra information, not authorized to be retrieved.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) was of a vision in which all physical objects are tagged and uniquely identified using RFID transponders or readers. Nowadays, research into the IoT has extended this vision to the connectivity of Things to anything, anyone, anywhere and at anytime. The IoT has grown into multiple dimensions, which encompasses various networks of applications, computers, devices, as well as physical and virtual objects, referred to as things or objects, that are interconnected together using communication technologies such as, wireless, wired and mobile networks, RFID, Bluetooth, GPS systems, and other evolving technologies. This paradigm is a major shift from an essentially computer-based network model to a fully distributed network of smart objects. This change poses serious challenges in terms of architecture, connectivity, efficiency, security and provision of services among many others. This paper studies the state-of-the art of the IoT. In addition, some major security and privacy issues are described and a new attack vector is introduced, referred to as the äóìautomated invasion attackäó.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) envisions billions of sensors to be connected to the Internet. By deploying intelligent low-level computational devices such as mobile phones in-between sensors and cloud servers, we can reduce data communication with the use of intelligent processing such as fusing and filtering sensor data, which saves significant amount of energy. This is also ideal for real world sensor deployments where connecting sensors directly to a computer or to the Internet is not practical. Most of the leading IoT middleware solutions require manual and labour intensive tasks to be completed in order to connect a mobile phone to them. In this paper we present a mobile application called Mobile Sensor Hub (MoSHub). It allows variety of different sensors to be connected to a mobile phone and send the data to the cloud intelligently reducing network communication. Specifically, we explore techniques that allow MoSHub to be connected to cloud based IoT middleware solutions autonomously. For our experiments, we employed Global Sensor Network (GSN) middleware to implement and evaluate our approach. Such automated configuration reduces significant amount of manual labour that need to be performed by technical experts otherwise. We also evaluated different methods that can be used to automate the configuration process.},

The emphasis is on conditions for virtual excavations, techniques which could be used to support them as well as their analytical value to making sense of what and how people do (interact) online. A case study is used to provide baseline data for framing the notion of digital remains or traces of virtual settlements, the form they take in today's social web and the means through which they are revealed and made sense of using social visualization techniques. It turns out that virtual excavations organized around cultural artifacts of practice can provide valuable insight, not only into structural properties of 'social' technologies and the way in which they are appropriated, but also dynamic aspects of the enacted cyber-structures resulting from recurrent co-engagement and online collaboration.},

However, realizing IP-WSNs in IoT exposes two major challenges. One is how to embed the Internet Protocol (IP) in resource-constrained sensor nodes. The other is how to achieve real-world deployment of WSNs and its integration with the Internet on the fly and on the cheap. In this paper, we present the SNAIL (Sensor Networks for All-IP World) project and introduce a new type of IP-WSN gateway, which supports dual wireless access points for WiFi and IP-WSN, enabling deployment of SNAIL nodes in an easy and rapid manner as for the solution.

abstract={With recent advances in technologies such as radio-frequency identification (RFID) and new standards such as the electronic product code (EPC), large-scale traceability is emerging as a key differentiator in a wide range of enterprise applications (e.g., counterfeit prevention, product recalls, and pilferage reduction). Such traceability applications often need to access data collected by individual enterprises in a distributed environment. Traditional centralized approaches (e.g., data ware-housing) are not feasible for these applications due to their unique characteristics such as large volume of data and sovereignty of the participants. In this paper, we describe an approach that enables applications to share traceability data across independent enterprises in a pure Peer-to-Peer (P2P) fashion. Data are stored in local repositories of participants and indexed in the network based on structured P2P overlays. In particular, we present a generic approach for efficiently indexing and locating individual objects in large, distributed traceable networks, most notably, in the emerging environment of the Internet of Things. The results from extensive experiments show that our approach scales well in both data volume and network size.},

abstract={Nowadays, we are witnessing formation of a new technological marvel: Internet of Things. This construction is able to combine in a particular operational entity all the bits and pieces of the world around us. Thus, why could not this unique establishment present the long-sought essence in the Nature of Things? The two pillars of modern fundamental science-relativity and quantum mechanics-are just approximate descriptions of some properties of such a constructive possibility. The machinery of the physical world develops on a cellular automaton model employing as the transformation rule the mechanism of distributed mutual synchronization with the property of fault-tolerance. This infrastructure yields traveling wave solutions that exactly correspond to the spectrum of the stable elementary particles of matter with an upper bound on the propagation speed. On top of the considered cellular automaton infrastructure there appears a secondary formation that constitutes the mechanism of the Holographic Universe that is the basis for the Internet of Things. The holographic activities determine all the quantum mechanics properties of the physical world including the nonlocality entanglement. For living systems the arrangement of the Internet of Things elucidates the most puzzling biological capability of morphogenesis that otherwise cannot find any reasonable explanation. In this paper, we present the world view of internet of things and the application of this methodology from geospatial computing to physics. We give specific details on applying IoT concept to geospatial analysis in various fields from agriculture to medicine. We also provide detailed analysis of the profound impact of internet of things on our physical world which is a vital knowledge when it comes to geospatial research. We present calendar variation of quantum world which can be used for geospatial data gathering by fine tuning the equipment based on the time of the year.},

abstract={Enabling the Internet of Things (IoT) requires a global identification system for things to be distinguished from trillions of things and to make them globally accessible from the Internet. Unfortunately, the current Internet architecture using an IP address as both ID and locator (i.e., address) makes it difficult to improve networking solutions for the IoT. To solve this, we newly design novel IoT architecture composed of Things' Identification Service (TIDS) and Things' Profile Service (TPS), enabling things to use both a domain name and a global ID in globally accessing other things in the world. It also exploits existing Domain Name Service (DNS) and Dynamic DNS (DDNS) to trace of mobile thing's changing IP address. In addition to this, we develop Things' Application-level Protocol (TALP) to provide users with transparent access to the things over heterogeneous networks. To show the feasibility, we implement TIDS, TPS, and TALP and construct the test-bed for the proposed IoT architecture. Based on this, we prove the feasibility of the proposed IoT architecture.},

Merging all these technologies with the Internet is often described as 'Internet of Things' (IoT). In the IoT vision, Things around us provide a pervasive network of interacting and interconnected devices. However building IoT applications is a long and arduous work, reserved for specialists, requiring specific knowledge's in terms of network protocols and programming languages. The lack of widespread and easy-to-configure solutions is an obstacle for the development of this area. A universal framework, offering simplification and standardization, could facilitate the emergence of this promising field in terms of applications and business. IoT needs a solid foundation for rapid, simple development and deployment of new services. In this paper, we present D-LITe, a universal framework for building IoT applications over heterogeneous sets of small devices. D-LITe offers solutions for deploying application's logic, and executing it on Smart Objects despite their heterogeneity. An implementation of D-LITe on tiny devices, such as TelosB motes, allows to show that our framework is realistic even with the constraints of such devices.},

abstract={This paper examines the benefits of edge mining -data mining that takes place on the wireless, battery-powered, and smart sensing devices that sit at the edge points of the Internet of Things. Through local data reduction and transformation, edge mining can quantifiably reduce the number of packets that must be sent, reducing energy usage, and remote storage requirements. In addition, edge mining has the potential to reduce the risk in personal privacy through embedding of information requirements at the sensing point, limiting inappropriate use. The benefits of edge mining are examined with respect to three specific algorithms: linear Spanish inquisition protocol (L-SIP), ClassAct, and bare necessities (BN), which are all instantiations of general SIP. In general, the benefits provided by edge mining are related to the predictability of data streams and availability of precise information requirements; results show that L-SIP typically reduces packet transmission by around 95% (20-fold), BN reduces packet transmission by 99.98% (5000-fold), and ClassAct reduces packet transmission by 99.6% (250-fold). Although energy reduction is not as radical because of other overheads, minimization of these overheads can lead up to a 10-fold battery life extension for L-SIP, for example. These results demonstrate the importance of edge mining to the feasibility of many IoT applications.},

Our context model is used for service match and service composition to reduce the consumption of devices resources and cost.},

The properties of the IOT make the differences between the resource addressing in the IOT (RA-IOT) and that in the Internet. There are some peculiar problems of the RA-IOT, such as the conflict of there source addressing caused by multiple product code standards (PCSs). So the IOT makes some new challenges to the existing technology of the resource addressing in the Internet, which can not totally meets the requirements of the IOT. The relevant researches related to the IOT are still in their infancy, and most of them just use the Internetpsilas existing technology, so they cannot resolve the addressing conflict of different PCSs. By analyzing the properties of the RA-IOT, this paper proposes the general layered model of the RA-IOT by extending the layered iteration model in the Internet. Based on the model, this paper puts forward the universal resource addressing system which can support any PCS. By the test of the system, the validity and feasibility of the model and the system can be verified.},

abstract={The HIP Diet EXchange (DEX) is an end-to-end security protocol designed for constrained network environments in the IP-based Internet of Things (IoT). It is a variant of the IETF-standardized Host Identity Protocol (HIP) with a refined protocol design that targets performance improvements of the original HIP protocol. To stay compatible with existing protocol extensions, the HIP DEX specification thereby aims at preserving the general HIP architecture and protocol semantics. As a result, HIP DEX inherits the verbose HIP packet structure and currently does not consider the available potential to tailor the transmission overhead to constrained IoT environments. In this paper, we present Slimfit, a novel compression layer for HIP DEX. Most importantly, Slimfit i) preserves the HIP DEX security guarantees, ii) allows for stateless (de-)compression at the communication end-points or an on-path gateway, and iii) maintains the flexible packet structure of the original HIP protocol. Moreover, we show that Slimfit is also directly applicable to the original HIP protocol. Our evaluation results indicate a maximum compression ratio of 1.55 for Slimfit-compressed HIP DEX packets. Furthermore, Slimfit reduces HIP DEX packet fragmentation by 25 % and thus further decreases the transmission overhead for lossy network links. Finally, the compression of HIP DEX packets leads to a reduced processing time at the network layers below Slimfit. As a result, processing of Slimfit-compressed packets shows an overall performance gain at the HIP DEX peers.},

abstract={Communication and information access defines the basis to reach a personalized health end-to-end framework. Personalized health capability is limited to the available data from the patient. The data is usually dynamic and incomplete. Therefore, it presents a critical issue for mining, analysis and trending. For that reason, this work presents an interconnection framework for mobile Health (mHealth) based on the Internet of Things. It makes continuous and remote vital sign monitoring feasible and introduces technological innovations for empowering health monitors and patient devices with Internet capabilities. It also allows patient monitoring and supervision by remote centers, and personal platforms such as tablets. In terms of hardware it offers a gateway and a personal clinical device used for the wireless transmission of continuous vital signs through 6LoWPAN, and patient identification through RFID. In terms of software, this interconnection framework presents a novel protocol, called YOAPY, for an efficient, secure, and scalable integration of the sensors deployed in the patient's personal environment. This paper presents the architecture and evaluates its capability to provide continuous monitoring, ubiquitous connectivity, extended device integration, reliability, and security and privacy support. The proposed interconnection framework and the proposed protocol for the sensors have been exhaustively evaluated in the framework of the AIRE project, which is focused on patients with breathing problem. This evaluates for the proposed protocol the data aggregation mechanism level, Round-Trip delay Time, impact of the distance, and the impact of the security. It has been concluded that secure continuous monitoring is feasible with the use of the proposed {YOAPY}} aggregation mechanisms and the capabilities from the proposed interconnection framework.},

In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous online and offline signcryption scheme to secure communication between a sensor node and an Internet host. We prove that this scheme is indistinguishable against adaptive chosen ciphertext attacks under the bilinear Diffie-Hellman inversion problem and existential unforgeability against adaptive chosen messages attacks under the q-strong Diffie-Hellman problem in the random oracle model. Our scheme has the following advantages. First, it achieves confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation in a logical single step. Second, it allows a sensor node in an identity-based cryptography to send a message to an Internet host in a public key infrastructure. Third, it splits the signcryption into two phases: i) offline phase; and ii) online phase. In the offline phase, most heavy computations are done without the knowledge of a message. In the online phase, only light computations are done when a message is available. Our scheme is very suitable to provide security solution for integrating WSN into the IoT.},

All novel solutions phase the same problem: the lack of standards and widely accepted solutions. The City of Barcelona with the collaboration from research centers and industrial partners has been testing the smart city concept with the double purpose to contribute to the creation of standards and providing in the interim a solution to cope with the heterogeneity of providers, in particular from the wireless sensor part. This work has been structured as a ""Barcelona Intelligent City"" project or BCI. BCI project considers all the steps of the data process from its capture by a sensor network to the processing to make it relevant (pointing events that requires attention) and rich (with context information). Conclusions from the pilots has started to be applied. One example is the sensoring in civil works control. This paper includes some lines about Avinguda de l'Estatut Civil Works Project and its conclusions.},

abstract={The number of small embedded devices connected to the Internet is increasing. This growth is mostly due to the large number of Internet of Things (IoT) deployments, with applications such as: industrial monitoring, home automation, and others. One common aspect with the majority of application areas is the lack of mobility. Most IoT devices are stationary and often use IEEE 802.15.4/6LoWPAN solutions. When a high level of mobility is required, the use of IEEE 802.15.4 is not possible without adding additional hardware for the user to carry. In this article, a holistic network architecture consisting of heterogeneous devices is presented. The architecture is composed of Embedded Internet Systems (EIS) and uses standard communication protocols. One important feature is the use of the Service-oriented architecture (SOA) paradigm. The use of SOA, by utilization of the CoAP protocol and standard services, enables the proposed architecture to exchange sensor- and actuator data with an Internet-based cloud as well as a user's local cloud consisting of sensor IoT devices, smart phones and laptops. Another component of the architecture is a web-based human-machine interface for configuration, monitoring and visualization of sensor and actuator data using emerging web technologies for structured data processing. Results from experiments and real-world tests show that the proposed architecture can support sample rates of up to several kHz while enabling sensor data to be transmitted to SOA services in real time. This proves that the use of SOA, and Restful web services in particular, is feasible on resource-constrained platforms while supporting true mobility.},

They provide key functionalities useful for a really viable Internet of Things. However, several open issues still remain and require research efforts to be solved. Among others, the design of effective scheduling schemes in such systems is one of the major problems; in fact, there are no specifications about how schedules should be realized. Trying to fill this gap, this paper presents a new Decentralized Traffic-Aware Scheduling algorithm, which is able to construct optimum multi-hop schedules in a distributed fashion. Its effectiveness has been proved by using simulation results and comparing it with a centralized scheme. The reported performance results encourage the use of the developed scheduling technique, since it allows a very efficient queue management, and thus it minimizes packet discards due to buffer overflows, while at the same time minimizing the network duty cycle.},

abstract={In recent years, a large body of research has been dedicated to the 'lightweight' implementation of Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) for RFID tags, wireless sensor nodes, and other 'smart' devices that are supposed to become components of the Internet of Things (IoT). However, making ECC suitable for the IoT is far from trivial since many applications demand fast response times (i.e. high performance), but nonetheless call for small silicon area and low power consumption. We tackle this challenge through hardware/software co-design and introduce an 8-bit Application-Specific Instruction Set Processor (ASIP) that combines the efficiency of a dedicated hardware implementation with the flexibility and scalability of ECC software. Our ASIP is based on JAAVR ('Just Another AVR'), an ATmega128 clone into which we integrated a relatively small (32x4)-bit Multiply- Accumulate (MAC) unit optimized to speed up multi-precision arithmetic. To demonstrate the flexibility of our co-design, we implemented scalar multiplication over four families of elliptic curve, namely a Weierstrass curve, a twisted Edwards curve, a Montgomery curve, and a Gallant-Lambert-Vanstone curve. All curves use a 160-bit Optimal Prime Field (OPF) as underlying algebraic structure, which allows for particularly fast execution of the modular reduction on JAAVR. When using 'native' AVR instructions only, our fastest implementation of scalar multiplication reaches an execution time of less than 4M clock cycles on a conventional ATmega128 processor. Taking advantage of the MAC unit, the time for a full 160-bit scalar multiplication falls below 1M cycles, whereas a 'leakage-reducing' implementation that does not execute any security-critical conditional statements needs some 1.3M cycles. A low-memory variant of the extended JAAVR occupies an area of merely 21k gates, making it suitable for resource-constrained IoT devices like sensor nodes.},

The potential of such a change is still to be fully exploited, and phenomena such as social networks and cloud computing are just two of the many innovative solutions that have been born from the Web 2.0. At the same time, a new class of users is establishing itself in the Internet landscape: in fact, with the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), smart objects are becoming the new, and possibly the biggest, Internet community. In this paper, we propose WebIoT, a novel web application framework, based on Google Web Toolkit, aimed at enhancing the interaction among things and between humans and things. Our framework leverages on the following principles: thing-centric design, modularity and web service communications. We will describe the main components of the framework, their interactions and how simple it is to develop any custom IoT application integrating any number and type of smart things. In particular, we will show how different things can be integrated in the framework, how they interact and how users can exploit these interactions to develop any complex functionality. Finally, we describe a typical HealthCare application for the IoT realized using WebIoT.},

The sensors and related data streams can be clustered physically or virtually, which raises the challenge of searching and selecting the right sensors for a query in an efficient and effective way. This paper proposes a context-aware sensor search, selection, and ranking model, called CASSARAM, to address the challenge of efficiently selecting a subset of relevant sensors out of a large set of sensors with similar functionality and capabilities. CASSARAM considers user preferences and a broad range of sensor characteristics such as reliability, accuracy, location, battery life, and many more. This paper highlights the importance of sensor search, selection and ranking for the IoT, identifies important characteristics of both sensors and data capture processes, and discusses how semantic and quantitative reasoning can be combined together. This paper also addresses challenges such as efficient distributed sensor search and relational-expression based filtering.

However, there is a main drawback within these technologies which is to provide the low computation devices. Such a drawback limits the capabilities of RFID and WS. These technologies can hold a very sensitive data that may be related to the physical world such as the names or places of people. Thus, exposing this data can lead to security breach issues and researchers tried to come up with different security solutions with low computation. However, adding security to such low computation devices is a great challenge as they need a suitable lightweight cipher that is able to fit their properties.

It is shown that the TR technique is a promising technique that focuses signal waves in both time and space domains. The unique asymmetric architecture significantly reduces the cost of the terminal devices, the total number of which is expected to be very large for IoT. The focusing effect of the TR technique can harvest the energy of all the multi-paths at the receiver, which improves the energy efficiency of the wireless transmission and thus the battery life of terminal devices in IoT. Facilitated by the high-resolution spatial focusing, the TR division multiple access scheme leverages the uniqueness of the multi-path profiles in the rich-scattering environment and maps them into location-specific signatures, so that spatial multiplexing can be achieved for multiple users operating on the same spectrum. In addition, the TR system can easily support heterogeneous terminal devices by providing various quality-of-service (QoS) options through adjusting the waveform and rate backoff factor. Finally, the unique location-specific signature in TR system can provide additional physical-layer security and thus can enhance the privacy and security of customers in IoT. All the advantages show that the TR technique is a promising paradigm for IoT.},

abstract={With the advent of Internet of Things (IoT), more and more smart things automatically engage in people's daily life by various means as they are becoming capable of computation and communication. Both challenges and opportunities are posed. To exploit the potential of IoT, different concepts from various points of view have been explored. One of the IoT developing trend is so-called Ambient Intelligence (AI), which refers to things that are sensitive and responsive to the presence of other things and people. The things shall be aware of ambient environments (e.g., other things or people) and take actions accordingly. However, complicated configuration of AI hinders the popularity of IoT. To tackle this problem, we advocate applying the highly abstract concept of äóìIF-THENäó as the front-end of AI in IoT. To realize such a concept, we present a preliminary design in this paper, including issues of the architecture design, the uniformly understandable language and function assembly.},

Technical solutions should aim for a cooperative ecosystem by addressing the interoperability, security, and system integration. In this paper, we propose an ecosystem-driven design strategy and apply it in the design of an open-platform based solution. In particular, a cooperative ecosystem is formulated by merging the traditional healthcare and mobile internet ecosystems. Utilizing the existing standardization efforts, the interfaces between actors can be simplified. To balance the control and avoid monopoly, ecosystem-driven security schemes are proposed including the public-based authentication, repository-based credential management, SE-based cryptography, and non-invasive message handover. In order to achieve the economy of scale, an open platform-based in-home healthcare station is proposed. The proposed methodology and solution are demonstrated in implemented prototype system and field trials.},

It challenges the design and evaluation of IoT systems to meet the scalability, compatibility, extendibility, dynamic adaptability and resiliency requirements. In this paper, we design and evaluate a scalable, adaptive and survivable trust management protocol in dynamic IoT environments. Recognizing that entities in an IoT system are connected through social networks of entity owners, we consider a community of interest (CoI) based social IoT where nodes form into communities of interest. Given inter-CoI vs. intra-CoI social connections among entity owners as input, we identify best trust protocol settings for achieving convergence, accuracy, dynamic adaptability and resiliency properties in the presence of dynamically changing conditions and malicious nodes performing trust-related attacks. For scalability, we consider a design by which a node only keeps trust information of a subset of nodes meeting its interest and performs minimum computation to update trust. We validate our design by extensive simulation considering both limited and ideal (unlimited) storage space. The results demonstrate that our trust management protocol using limited storage space achieves a similar performance level compared with the one under ideal storage space, and a newly joining node can quickly build up trust towards other nodes with desirable accuracy and convergence behavior.},

As they often need to provide a number of sophisticated functions compared to simple sensor nodes, we combine the constrained application protocol (CoAP) with the ubiquitous ID (uID) architecture. The latter plays a crucial role for keeping the knowledge and data required for practical complex IoT services. In addition, we provide a software framework for embedded appliance nodes, designed to reduce the burden of embedded appliance manufacturers by providing an intuitive, consistent, and easy-to-use APL Based on this idea, our framework provides functions to build RESTful services in addition to the low-level communication API. We have evaluated our system through a case-study, and showed that our framework can be used effectively to implement practical IoT applications over existing embedded systems with a small programming effort.},

Contrary to past research efforts, our proposal is transparent and compatible both with the underlying low-layer protocols and diverse applications, and preserving energy-efficiency in the long run without sacrificing the QoI levels attained. Specifically, we first introduce the novel concept of QoI-aware äóìsensor-to-task relevancyäó to explicitly consider the sensing capabilities offered by an sensor to the IoT sensory environments, and QoI requirements required by a task. Second, we propose a novel concept of the äóìcritical covering setäó of any given task in selecting the sensors to service a task over time. Third, energy management decision is made dynamically at runtime, to reach the optimum for long-term application arrivals and departures under the constraint of their service delay. Finally, an extensive case study based on utilizing the sensing sensors to perform water quality monitoring is given to demonstrate the ideas and algorithms proposed in this paper, and a complete simulation is made to support all performance analysis.},

Instead, we propose a set of efficient grid-based channel allocation and access scheduling algorithms using Latin squares, called as GAALS, for scalable WSNs with single-radio multi-channel communication capabilities. Using nodal location information and forming grids over the WSN deployment area, GAALS maps Latin squares to the grids, and dynamically assigns multiple channels to the WSN grids for channel access scheduling purposes. The fairness and scalability of GAALS are analyzed and evaluated in multiflow multihop WSNs with multi-channel capabilities. The results show that GAALS achieves much better performance than other multichannel protocols.},

The numerical results on minimal energy consumption and network lifetime of the system indicate that the deployment scheme proposed in this paper is more flexible and energy efficient compared to typical WSN deployment scheme; thus is applicable to the green IoT deployment.},

The platform was designed based on the following technologies. In aspect of goods identification, a global unified electronic product code EPC was adopted and each goods was given a unique code that was according with international standards. Reading and writing EPC data was by taking use of RFID technology, which read data from electronic tags via a wireless non-contact method. In aspect of goods code management, new concepts of dynamic EPC and static EPC were proposed for goods in transport and movement. Through introduction of dynamic EPC and static EPC, data flow significantly was reduced, the management process was simplified and management efficiency was improved. In aspect of network transmission, both wired network and wireless network were taken for transmission task. Wired networks were available based on Internet and LAN. For mobile sites, wireless network GRPS was used for communication. In aspect of positioning goods, global positioning system GPS was used for location and tracking of goods. In aspect of platform function design, the system's function requirements were analyzed and designed, and a series of its functions were proposed, such as real-time data acquisition, automatic alarm, remote control, data control and processing, historical information record and product quality safety tracing, market analysis and intelligent projections etc..

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the networked interconnection of everyday objects. IoT is an upcoming research field and is being regarded as the revolution in the world of communication because of its extensible applications in numerous fields. Due to open and self-assimilation nature of these networks they are highly prone to attacks. Because of this reason security is of primary concern here. The security attack can be of various types, the idea here is to prevent IoT networks from Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. The objective of Denial of Service (DoS) is to make the server resources unavailable to the intended user, and when several such DoS attacks are present in a network then the attack is known as a DDoS attack. Our strategy is to prevent DDoS attack in IoT networks by using Learning Automata (LA) concepts. In this paper, we present a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) which is used as a system model for IoT here. SOA provides a platform to the developers using which they can develop various applications for IoT without any concern regarding the nature of the objects, thereby acting as a middleware. The DDoS prevention strategy has been targeted for the SOA based architecture for IoT. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme is effective in preventing DDoS attacks in IoT.},

Such applications are built on a distributed network of heterogeneous context-aware devices, where localization is a key issue. The localization problem is further magnified by IoT challenges such as scalability, mobility and the heterogeneity of objects. In existing localization systems using RFID technology, there is a lack of systems that localize mobile tags using heterogeneous mobile readers in a distributed manner. In this paper, we propose the GOSSIPY system for localizing mobile RFID tags using a group of ad hoc heterogeneous mobile RFID readers. The system depends on cooperation of mobile readers through time-constrained interleaving processes. Readers in a neighborhood share interrogation information, estimate tag locations accordingly and employ both proactive and reactive protocols to ensure timely dissemination of location information. We evaluate the proposed system and present its performance through extensive simulation experiments using ns-3.},

abstract={To realize the Internet of Things (IoT), an important step would be to allow things and information about them to be accessible in an easy way and a platform-independent manner. As World Wide Web (WWW, Web) shows explosive growth over the last decade, the web is the most popular and familiar user interface to acquire knowledge about everyday life. In this respect, web browsing through standard protocols like HTTP over TCP could be a promising approach to access things and to collect things' information. In future, IP-based wireless sensor networks (IP-WSNs) are expected to be integrated into the IoT. However, due to the characteristics of IP-WSN such as resource limited and low data-rate, the challenges that we confronted are 1) how to make clients access IP-WSNs as if they use regular web browsers with rich presentation and acceptable response time and 2) how to embed the standard web in such resource-constrained sensor nodes. In this paper, to address these challenges, we introduce a new browsing architecture, which enables the exploration of the IP-WSNs through a conventional web browser and the navigation with rich user interfaces. We also design lightweight web protocols, lwHTTP and lwTCP, with header compression in order for HTTP and TCP to run on the resource-constrained IP-WSNs. To show the feasibility, we implement the proposed architecture in SNAIL (Sensor Networks for an All-IP world), our IP-WSN platform, and we evaluate the performance of proposed browsing architecture.},

abstract={Recent standardization efforts focus on a number of lightweight IP security protocol variants for end-to-end security in the Internet of Things (IoT), most notably DTLS, HIP DEX, and minimal IKEv2. These protocol variants commonly consider public-key-based cryptographic primitives in their protocol design for peer authentication and key agreement. In this paper, we identify several performance and security issues that originate from these public-key-based operations on resource-constrained IoT devices. To illustrate their impact, we additionally quantify these protocol limitations for HIP DEX. Most importantly, we find that public-key-based operations significantly hamper a peer's availability and response time during the protocol handshake. Hence, IP security protocols in the IoT must be tailored to reduce the need for expensive cryptographic operations, to protect resource-constrained peers against DoS attacks targeting these cryptographic operations, and to account for high message processing times. To this end, we present three complementary, lightweight protocol extensions for HIP DEX: i) a comprehensive session resumption mechanism, ii) a collaborative puzzle-based DoS protection mechanism, and iii) a refined retransmission mechanism. Our focus on common protocol functionality allows to generalize our proposed extensions to the wider scope of DTLS and IKE. Finally, our evaluation confirms the considerable achieved improvements at modest trade-offs.},

A number of pieces of research literature exist on community detection in SNs; however, no work specifically on integrated IoT and SN architecture addresses this issue. The existing community detection approaches have not considered things into account. We propose the scheme, Community Detection in an Integrated IoT and SN (CDIISN) in which we divide the nodes/actors in complex networks into basic nodes and IoT nodes, and execute the community detection algorithm. We consider two nodes to be in a community, only if the nodes are at most one hop apart and have at least two mutual friends. The smallest community in our case is a subgraph with a cycle of length four. In our approach, a node can be part of multiple communities, and it works well for weighted graphs. Once communities are extracted, we use an access control scheme, based on which access to nodes is provided. This approach of community detection in an integrated environment would find tremendous use in the future, because in the case of any search operation performed by any node, the results obtained intra-community are more relevant than inter-community.},

abstract={The incidence of serious and fatal Adverse Drugs Reaction (ADR) and harmful effects of pharmaceutical excipients in worldwide hospitals is extremely high. Some studies show a rate of ADR appearance about 6.5% in worldwide hospitals. The consequences of these cases lead to a rate of 80% of ADR incidences that require the patient admission, a medium bed stay of eight days, a cost of $847m and an overall death rate of 0.15%. Most of these consequences can be avoided. For this reason, a drugs checker based on Internet of things and a knowledge-based system is proposed in this paper to detect ADRs and allergy interactions. Specifically, the patient's terminal identifies the drugs by means of either NFC (Near Field Communication) or barcode, using common devices such as cellular phones, PDAs or PCs. This information is matched with the Pharmaceutical Intelligent Information System to detect whether a drug or product is compatible with its allergy profile and Electronic Health Record (EHR) or not. The system is being tested with a first approximation based on smart phones and a real patient which suffer a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) intolerance. This patient cannot tolerate some Active Ingredients (AI) such as ibuprofen. Therefore, when the patient checks a drug that contains one of the not tolerated AI, the system warns the patient about the incompatibility with his allergy profile and EHR, by means of a friendly interface.},

abstract={Current communication and computation technologies make it possible to embed intelligence and communication capabilities in most of the things surrounding us; this leading to the Internet of Things (IoT) concept. To really exploit the potential of the IoT, objects and provided services should be easily discoverable and usable by humans and by other objects. Besides, trustworthiness of the billions of members of the IoT should be a key element in service selection. Existing solutions for service discovery in IoT do not scale with the number of nodes that is expected to be order of magnitude larger than in the current Internet. In this paper we propose to build a social network, that we name the Social Internet of Things (SIoT), that can be used to provide a navigable structure to the IoT. We also provide a framework that can be applied to socially tie things together and a preliminary architecture to be used as a baseline for the implementation of the SIoT. Our work demonstrates that standards should support establishment and management of federations of objects (ruled by social relationships) that represent äóìcommunitiesäó of things in the SIoT.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is emerging as the major trend in shaping the development of the next generation of information networks. The challenges of the enormous, dynamic, incredibly diverse and high complexity of the IoT urgently require novel self-organization scheme because most of the existing distributed self-organization schemes cannot be directly applied to it. In this paper, we propose an intelligent self-organizing scheme (ISOS) for the IoT inspired by the endocrine regulating mechanism. For each node in the network, an autonomous area is established, where the node can effectively interact with its peers and perform self-control according to its own status and dynamic circumstance in a decentralized infrastructure. By introducing the hormone mechanism as the medium for information transmission and data sharing, the nodes can collaborate with each other and work in a cooperative way. Through adjusting the release procedure of the hormones, the ability to effectively detect service randomly generated can also be guaranteed in the probabilistic partially-working IoT. Simulation results verify the performance of the proposed mechanism that entitles the IoT to the ability of maintaining its status in a globally stable status, while effectively discovering the random service requests in a resource-critical configuration. The ISOS would be of great significance for the practical implementation of the IoT.},

Whereas several IoT platforms are already available, the SIoT paradigm has represented only a field for pure research and simulations, until now. The aim of this paper is to present our implementation of a SIoT platform. We begin by analyzing the major IoT implementations, pointing out their common characteristics that could be re-used for our goal. We then discuss the major extensions we had to introduce on the existing platforms to introduce the functionalities of the SIoT. We also present the major functionalities of the proposed system: how to register a new social object to the platform, how the system manages the creation of new relationships, and how the devices create groups of members with similar characteristics.

The framework uses an adapter oriented approach to address the issue of connectivity with different types of smart objects. We employ a query based service re-route mechanism to decouple service provider and service consumer. We propose micro-formats based service description template for associating smart object location with its service end-point. As a step toward enhancing smart objects service publication and discovery, we adopt a service advertisement approach within the IoT cloud perimeter that automates service publication and discovery process. Our proof-of-concept prototype implementation shows that the existing technology enablers are capable of realizing the service oriented IoT vision, which does not only plug smart objects into the internet but also link the information resided in smart objects into the fabric of the web.},

However, there is a bottleneck in state of the art IOT applications, which require sensors to response on abstract and complex requests similar to human natural languages. On the contrary, since sensors' service directories are unable to map their services on how users' abstract queries can be performed, sensors can only response to low-level queries with accurate and complete descriptions. To handle this challenge, in this paper, we proposed a novel ontology based method to improve sensor systems' reasoning. The key lies on any abstract terminologies can be understood by searching their ontologies descriptions. Therefore, by utilizing ontologies, abstract queries can be hierarchically decomposed into several simple queries handled by single sensors. Moreover, ontologies also imply the logical relations on the feedbacks from each single queries, and the answer can be carried out based on the equations and sensor outputs.},

In this paper, we introduce a novel data model and storage infrastructure for the IoT to address these challenges. Different from other works in the literature, we exploit a document-oriented approach and show how it is suitable to support both heterogeneous and multimedia data. Our solution is built on top of the CouchDB database server, offers a Restful API, and provides a rich set of features targeted to IoT applications. Moreover, we devise optimized schemes for uploading documents which are specifically tailored to resource-constrained IoT devices. We evaluate our proposed schemes both analytically and with experiments in a real system.},

This new generation is required, since customers are not only looking for products to satisfy their basic needs, wants, desires, and anxieties. They also need to satisfy their creativity and values such as defined in Marketing 3.0, but the most important, they also require to be part of the product, i.e. to be able to participate, interact with the products, and as a consequence of the impact from the Information technology era, be able to share their experience and check that the product really satisfies what it promises. Therefore, marketing is not moving more around the product, at the same way that Internet is not moving more around the data.

abstract={Wireless communication is indispensable to Internet of Things (IoT). Carrier sensing multiple access/collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) is a well-proven wireless random access protocol and allows each node of equal probability in accessing wireless channel, which incurs equal throughput in long term regardless of the channel conditions. To exploit node diversity that refers to the difference of channel condition among nodes, this paper proposes two opportunistic random access mechanisms: overlapped contention and segmented contention, to favor the node of the best channel condition. In the overlapped contention, the contention windows of all nodes share the same ground of zero, but have different upper bounds upon channel condition. In the segmented contention, the contention window upper bound of a better channel condition is smaller than the lower bound of a worse channel condition; namely, their contention windows are segmented without any overlapping. These algorithms are also polished to provide temporal fairness and avoid starving the nodes of poor channel conditions. The proposed mechanisms are analyzed, implemented, and evaluated on a Linux-based testbed and in the NS3 simulator. Extensive comparative experiments show that both opportunistic solutions can significantly improve the network performance in throughput, delay, and jitter over the current CSMA/CA protocol. In particular, the overlapped contention scheme can offer 73.3% and 37.5% throughput improvements in the infrastructure-based and ad hoc networks, respectively.},

In this paper, we argue that only connected is not enough, beyond that, general objects should have the capability to learn, think, and understand both physical and social worlds by themselves. This practical need impels us to develop a new paradigm, named cognitive Internet of Things (CIoT), to empower the current IoT with a äóìbrainäó for high-level intelligence. Specifically, we first present a comprehensive definition for CIoT, primarily inspired by the effectiveness of human cognition. Then, we propose an operational framework of CIoT, which mainly characterizes the interactions among five fundamental cognitive tasks: perception-action cycle, massive data analytics, semantic derivation and knowledge discovery, intelligent decision-making, and on-demand service provisioning. Furthermore, we provide a systematic tutorial on key enabling techniques involved in the cognitive tasks. In addition, we also discuss the design of proper performance metrics on evaluating the enabling techniques. Last but not the least, we present the research challenges and open issues ahead. Building on the present work and potentially fruitful future studies, CIoT has the capability to bridge the physical world (with objects, resources, etc.) and the social world (with human demand, social behavior, etc.), and enhance smart resource allocation, automatic network operation, and intelligent service provisioning.},

This paper proposes some considerations on cognitive robots based on radio frequency identification technology within Internet of Things, by adding a social dimension to human-robot and robot-robot interactions. Social networks can be used for storing and sharing links to resources of interest for the humanrobot and robot-robot interactions. A Stinger robot-based prototype was built to demonstrate the presented functionalities. The prototype shows that this model is not only flexible, but also practical.},

abstract={The trend ""Internet of Things"" (IoT) equips Objects with a Internet connection in order to let people benefit from this interconnectivity. We propose a concept which is not only about the interconnectivity of Objects but mainly how we could easily enhance our usage of Objects through data. The investment into omnipresent Internet-capable devices is not reasonable in every scenario. Our goal is to close this gap by assigning Objects to a unique key alongside which data is stored in a highly-scalable and available cloud service. By accessing this stream of data, which could be any type of data like photo, video or text, we can directly describe its past status to others. Also agreements in textual form can be made on Objects between users giving the ability to log interactions. The service is planned to be realized as App for mobile devices as well as website. With our service we aim to let users easily collect data about a Object and thus creating a digital representation within a high-speed cloud network, which is accessible by a user account. We believe that our system has massive potential to ease up previously time-consuming processes when information about Objects are gathered. Our system makes it possible to let end-users participate in the creation of a IoT based on collecting and assigning data, enhancing every ones ability to reason and interact with Objects.},

abstract={There is a consensus today among researchers that the Future Internet will be characterized by a significant shift towards the Internet of Things. Experts expect more than 50 billion devices connected to the Internet by 2020 (sensors, smartphones, laptops, cars, clothes, wristwatches, etc.). To ensure communication among these smart äóìthingsäó, first we need a proper addressing scheme. However, while in the traditional Internet (of People) usually an end-user communicated with another user identified by a specific (IP) address, in the Internet of Things it will be a common scenario to see that the communication targets a specific set of äóìthingsäó, identified by the current status or values of their resources, interfaces, or other context parameters. For example, imagine that we want to receive some traffic information from all the sensor nodes embedded in cars or smartphones that are on a certain street, have moved at least once in the last 5 minutes, and have their batteries charged at more than 20%. Or, we want to send some targeted advertisements to all the devices that are in the close neighborhood of our restaurant, have a video screen to display the ad, and have allowed in their profile the reception of ads. Multicast groups could be used for that, but traditional multicasting is not scalable for such a large number of groups, as multicast addresses cannot be aggregated. In this paper we propose therefore a context-aware addressing and routing solution based on Bloom filters, to supplement the traditional IPv6. This is a proof-of-concept paper that does not address all the fine details of such a solution; it just aims to show that Bloom filters could be very efficiently used to summarize context information, identify groups of things with certain similar characteristics, and make rapid routing decisions to reach these devices.},

abstract={Cyber-physical systems uses sensors, actuators, and computation to solve problems that cross the physical world and computational world. Traditionally, the systems have been designed to be specific to one application domain and to be managed by a single entity. However, to achieve scalability, it is necessary to reuse sensors and actuators across multiple application domains. This broad use of sensors and actuators, as envisioned for the Internet of Things, raises many new problems related to interoperability, resource sharing, security and trust, and economics. In this paper, we address the problem of trust - specifically how to verify sensor information that is gathered from multiple sensors that are managed by different entities using outlier detection. We present a technique for automatically deriving a model of the physical phenomenon that is measured by the sensors. This model is then used to compare sensor readings and to identify outliers through spatial and temporal interpolation. We evaluate our system and demonstrate its effectiveness in the context of weather sensing. Nevertheless, the technique is applicable to any application domain where the underlying phenomenon is continuous.},

abstract={Internet has emerged as a medium to connect people across the world for emailing, conferencing, on-line trading, gaming and so on. Internet of Things (IoT) is aimed at making daily lives more sophisticated, flexible and highly reachable to any objects across the world. In IoT, physical objects such as home appliances, vehicles, supply chain items, containers etc. will have digital identities and they will be context aware to sense the environment around them and interact with each other. The objects will be able to respond with the information useful for real-time decision making such as safely changing the lane while driving, automatically switching off the lights in a room when no one is around and so on. Effective monitoring of the environmental conditions to control issues such as pollution, disaster and global warming is another important objective of IoT. For IoT, objects are required to be made smart by embedding intelligence into them using technologies such as Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) and Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID). In addition to mobile communication technology, Internet will be the primary backbone of the communication channel of IoT. As Internet is a public (and insecure) channel, security is an important concern in IoT infrastructure to communicate the voluminous information across the globe in a secure and timely manner. In this paper, we discuss the potential scope of IoT, the major technologies involved in IoT infrastructure and some important application domains for IoT. We also discuss the security and privacy issues of two important technologies of IoT, namely, WSN and RFID.},

In particular the paper focuses on message scheduling in an IoT environment where things or sensors are clustered into groups with each group has a message broker that delivers the messages originated from the group to the ultimate receiver of the sensed data. The message scheduler operates on the brokers to decide which message to be transmitted first. While most message scheduling algorithms consider only application-layer features of messages (such as expiry time) the message scheduling algorithm proposed in this paper improve the overall IoT systems efficiency. Furthermore, via routing, energy efficiency has also become a salient feature of the proposed scheduling algorithm. The simulation results have shown the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed message scheduling algorithm both in terms of service response time and energy consumption.},

With the huge number of things/objects and sensors/actuators connected to the Internet, a massive and in some cases real-time data flow will be automatically produced by connected things and sensors. It is important to collect correct raw data in an efficient way; but more important is to analyze and mine the raw data to abstract more valuable information such as correlations among things and services to provide web of things or Internet of services.

Implementation of services and applications over the IoT architecture can take benefit of the cloud computing concept. Sensing-as-a-Service (S<sup>2</sup> aaS) is a cloud-inspired service model which enables access to the IoT. In this paper, we present a framework where IoT can enhance public safety by crowd management via sensing services that are provided by smart phones equipped with various types of sensors. In order to ensure trustworthiness in the presented framework, we propose a reputation-based (S<sup>2</sup> aaS) scheme, namely, Trustworthy Sensing for Crowd Management (TSCM) for front-end access to the IoT. TSCM collects sensing data based on a cloud model and an auction procedure which selects mobile devices for particular sensing tasks and determines the payments to the users of the mobile devices that provide data. Performance evaluation of TSCM shows that the impact of malicious users in the crowdsourced data can be degraded by 75% while trustworthiness of a malicious user converges to a value below 40% following few auctions. Moreover, we show that TSCM can enhance the utility of the public safety authority up to 85%.},

However, the integration of embedded devices into the Internet introduces several challenges, since many of the existing Internet technologies and protocols were not designed for this class of devices. In the past few years, there were many efforts to enable the extension of Internet technologies to constrained devices. Initially, this resulted in proprietary protocols and architectures. Later, the integration of constrained devices into the Internet was embraced by IETF, moving towards standardized IP-based protocols. Long time, most efforts were focusing on the networking layer. More recently, the IETF CoRE working group started working on an embedded counterpart of HTTP, allowing the integration of constrained devices into existing service networks. In this paper, we will briefly review the history of integrating constrained devices into the Internet, with a prime focus on the IETF standardization work in the ROLL and CoRE working groups.

It allows things and objects that embed RFID tags to be identified and to exchange information with each other. However, this new Internet is facing to some problems which are mainly related to the security of information exchange and the integration of RFID tags to the current Internet. The new version of the IETF Host Identity Protocol (HIP) proposed in the Thing to Thing in the Internet of Things project (T2TIT) overcomes the problem of security. Nevertheless, the integration of RFID tags into the IP world is still an open issue. Due to the lack of capacity and resources, these tags can not implement the entire IP stack. To address this issue, we propose in this paper, a new protocol HIP Address Protocol (HAT) that provides network services such as address translation system between the Tag RFID ID and IP addresses, encapsulation/decapsulation, fragmentation/reassembly and object mobility management services. We provide a detailed description of the proposed protocol. We also illustrate through significant scenarios how it operates.},

This paper therefore investigates the capacity of near field magnetically coupled communication systems in free space based on their equivalent circuit models. Only the capacity of near field magnetically coupled single-input-single-output (SISO) and multiple-input-single-output (MISO) inductive systems in free space are analyzed based on their equivalent circuit models. The analysis provides a basis for assessing the general inductively coupled MIMO communication system. We show that preferred architectures for placing the several MISO transmitter nodes are required to maximize the received power. The case for circular orbits around the receiver node which maximizes the received power several times compared to when only one transmitter is used (provided the crosstalk between the transmitters is insignificant) is demonstrated. The binary case on a circular orbit achieves eight times the capacity of a single-input-single-output system using identical system components and devices. We also demonstrate how to limit crosstalk through geometric architectures.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IOT) is a wireless ad-hoc network of everyday objects collaborating and cooperating with one other in order to accomplish some shared objectives. The envisioned high degrees of association of humans with IOT nodes require equally high degrees of reliability of the network. In order to render this reliability to IOT networks, it is necessary to make them tolerant to faults. In this paper, we propose mixed cross-layered and learning automata (LA)-based fault-tolerant routing protocol for IOTs, which assures successful delivery of packets even in the presence of faults between a pair of source and destination nodes. As this work concerns IOT, the algorithm designed should be highly scalable and should be able to deliver high degrees of performance in a heterogeneous environment. The LA and cross-layer concepts adopted in the proposed approach endow this flexibility to the algorithm so that the same standard can be used across the network. It dynamically adopts itself to the changing environment and, hence, chooses the optimal action. Since energy is a major concern in IOTs, the algorithm performs energy-aware fault-tolerant routing. To save on energy, all the nodes lying in the unused path are put to sleep. Again this sleep scheduling is dynamic and adaptive. The simulation results of the proposed strategy shows an increase in the overall energy-efficiency of the network and decrease in overhead, as compared to the existing protocols we have considered as benchmarks in this study.},

The proposed network architecture is router-free, in which efficient routing can be operated with percolations based on the six degrees of separation or small world network. A file transmission will be divided into two phases: routing phase and data transmission phase. In the routing phase, probe packets will be transmitted and forwarded in the network thus path selections are performed based on small-world strategy. In the second phase, the file will be encoded and transmitted using the paths selected at the first phase. In such a way, an efficient routing and data transmission mechanism can be built, with which we can construct a low-cost, flexible, ubiquitous stub network.},

This work deals with a seamless integration, discovery, and employment of smart objects into the Internet infrastructure under Human-to-Machine (H2M) communication aspects. We introduce an XMPP-based service provisioning sublayer for the IoT to integrate resource constrained devices seamlessly into the Internet by showing how XMPP can empower the collaboration between humans and smart objects. To meet the requirements of constrained devices, we propose to extend XMPP's publish-subscribe capabilities with a topic-based filter mechanism to effectively reduce the number of exchanged XMPP messages. We further present standardized bootstrapping and handling processes for smart objects that adapt automatically to infrastructure and ad hoc network environments and do not require predefined parameters or user interaction. The applicability of XMPP for constrained devices is further demonstrated with an XMPP client and mDNS/DNS-SD service for the Contiki operating system.},

On the other hand, the Internet of Things (IoT) is a direction of the future Internet. Due to the existence of large amounts of weak network devices (NDs) with constrained resources, current CCN models that are designed mainly oriented to Super Routers (SRs) in the core networks are not appropriate for the edge networks in IoT. In this paper, we propose an internetworking scheme for weak NDs based on task mapping. In this scheme, weak NDs with constrained resources map the overcapacity tasks (in terms of storing, publishing, and retrieving) to SRs. Then, based on this scheme, we present two specific strategies for NDs as producers and consumers, respectively. Finally, we take cameras as typical NDs to illustrate the process of the communication by using our proposed scheme.},

abstract={Pervasive computing and Internet of Things (IoTs) paradigms have created a huge potential for new business. To fully realize this potential, there is a need for a common way to abstract the heterogeneity of devices so that their functionality can be represented as a virtual computing platform. To this end, we present novel semantic level interoperability architecture for pervasive computing and IoTs. There are two main principles in the proposed architecture. First, information and capabilities of devices are represented with semantic web knowledge representation technologies and interaction with devices and the physical world is achieved by accessing and modifying their virtual representations. Second, global IoT is divided into numerous local smart spaces managed by a semantic information broker (SIB) that provides a means to monitor and update the virtual representation of the physical world. An integral part of the architecture is a resolution infrastructure that provides a means to resolve the network address of a SIB either using a physical object identifier as a pointer to information or by searching SIBs matching a specification represented with SPARQL. We present several reference implementations and applications that we have developed to evaluate the architecture in practice. The evaluation also includes performance studies that, together with the applications, demonstrate the suitability of the architecture to real-life IoT scenarios. In addition, to validate that the proposed architecture conforms to the common IoT-A architecture reference model (ARM), we map the central components of the architecture to the IoT-ARM.},

abstract={Recently, the concept of Internet of Things, referred to as IoT, has drawn a great deal of research attention for realizing an intelligent society. The IoT is expected to comprise millions of heterogeneous smart äóìthingsäó having sensor terminals, which may collect various types of information. By sending these collected information via IoT, it is possible to construct many smart systems, e.g., automatic prevention of traffic jam and so on. However, the coverage of IoT and the capacity of its ground networks are, still, not capable enough to connect the numerous devices and terminals deployed all over the world. Therefore, there is an urgent need for effective data collection in such systems. In this paper, we focus on effective data collection by satellite-routed sensor system, which makes it possible to gather data from wide areas arbitrarily yet efficiently. However, multiple accesses from the numerous things to a satellite result in data collisions and increase the delay. For effectively resolving the problem of data collisions, we envision a new method, which utilizes a äóìdivide and conqueräó approach to collect data from the numerous things based upon demand. Also, we mathematically demonstrate how to optimize the operating time of our proposed. The effectiveness of our proposal is evaluated through numerical results.},

abstract={The strong development of the Internet of Things (IoT) is dramatically changing traditional perceptions of the current Internet towards an integrated vision of smart objects interacting with each other. While in recent years many technological challenges have already been solved through the extension and adaptation of wireless technologies, security and privacy still remain as the main barriers for the IoT deployment on a broad scale. In this emerging paradigm, typical scenarios manage particularly sensitive data, and any leakage of information could severely damage the privacy of users. This paper provides a concise description of some of the major challenges related to these areas that still need to be overcome in the coming years for a full acceptance of all IoT stakeholders involved. In addition, we propose a distributed capability-based access control mechanism which is built on public key cryptography in order to cope with some of these challenges. Specifically, our solution is based on the design of a lightweight token used for access to CoAP Resources, and an optimized implementation of the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) inside the smart object. The results obtained from our experiments demonstrate the feasibility of the proposal and show promising in order to cover more complex scenarios in the future, as well as its application in specific IoT use cases.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) integrates a large amount of everyday life devices from heterogeneous network environments, bringing a great challenge into security and reliability management. Recognizing that the smart objects in IoT are most likely human-carried or human-operated devices, we propose a scalable trust management protocol for IoT, with the emphasis on social relationships. We consider multiple trust properties including honesty, cooperativeness, and community-interest to account for social interaction. Each node performs trust evaluation towards a limited set of devices of its interest only. The trust management protocol is event-driven upon the occurrence of a social encounter or interaction event, and trust is aggregated using both direct observations and indirect recommendations. We analyze the effect of trust parameters on trust assessment accuracy and trust convergence time. Our results show that there exists a trade-off between trust assessment accuracy vs. trust convergence time in the presence of false recommendations attacks performed by malicious nodes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed trust management protocol with a trust-based service composition application. Our results indicate that trust-based service composition significantly outperforms non-trust-based (random) service composition and its performance approaches the maximum achievable performance with global knowledge.},

Thus, the network entities are addressed in a natural way from the knowledge the entities have about each other. This way we achieve a flexible, scalable, and sustainable naming for the entities. Finally, the Identity-to-Identity communication (session) is instantiated in top of a lightweight identifier-based network, so the sessions are the junction between the underlying transport network and the identity-based network architecture.},

abstract={In the Internet of Things (IoT) era, smart devices that are equipped with various types of sensors can enable access to the IoT architecture through a cloud-inspired service model, namely Sensing-as-a-Service (S<sup>2</sup>aaS). S<sup>2</sup>aaS can provide crowdsourced data to an application running on a cloud platform. The crowdsourced data can be used for several purposes such as public safety. One of the biggest challenges here is the incentive mechanisms for the users who are requested to provide S<sup>2</sup>aaS. In this paper, we propose mobility-aware trustworthy crowdsourcing (MATCS) framework in a cloud-centric IoT architecture which adopts and extends a previous scheme, Trustworthy Sensing for Crowd Management (TSCM) [1] by incorporating user mobility-awareness in the presence of maliciously altered sensing data. MATCS employs a user-centric incentive mechanism which collects sensing data based on an auction procedure. In the auction procedure, MATCS uses users' reputations, bids, current location and their estimated dislocation during crowdsourcing process. Furthermore, in order to investigate the benefits of reputation-awareness, we also propose reputation-unaware Mobility-Aware Crowdsourcing (MACS). Performance of MATCS is evaluated via simulations, and it is compared to MACS and a benchmark scheme, which aims at making a compromise between the utilities of the users and the platform by considering neither mobility nor trustworthiness. Simulation results confirm that mobility-awareness improves the utility of the platform significantly whereas combining reputation-awareness and mobility-awareness by MATCS can triple the improvement. Besides, user incomes are not significantly impacted by MACS or MATCS when users are mobile. Furthermore, maliciously altered data ratio can be degraded by 20%~55% by reputation-awareness in MATCS.},

The high rate of flexibility in combination with a light-weight structure avoids unnecessary overhead, associated with the benefits of standardization. JSON can be used in heterogeneous compute nodes, as it can be parsed easily and without special requirements. This way it provides an efficient method for transferring various data and for exploiting dynamic and partial reconfiguration in the area of distributed embedded systems. The result is an efficient communication structure with a consistent format for highly flexible and adaptive systems.},

Yet the large amount of events that emerge in daily business cannot be handled manually. That's why Complex Event Processing (CEP) engines have been developed to analyze large streams of simple events and aggregate them to business relevant complex events. To describe the aggregation rules, these engines use technical and formal languages which are difficult to handle for business experts. Hence, business experts are often not properly involved into the formulation of complex events. Therefore this paper proposes a conceptual modeling language that allows business experts to formulate complex events according to business needs. The proposed modeling language is demonstrated in a quality management scenario in the automotive manufacturing industry and is defined with OMG's MOF standard.},

abstract={IP technology for resource-constrained devices enables transparent end-to-end connections between a vast variety of devices and services in the Internet of Things (IoT). To protect these connections, several variants of traditional IP security protocols have recently been proposed for standardization, most notably the DTLS protocol. In this paper, we identify significant resource requirements for the DTLS handshake when employing public-key cryptography for peer authentication and key agreement purposes. These overheads particularly hamper secure communication for memory-constrained devices. To alleviate these limitations, we propose a delegation architecture that offloads the expensive DTLS connection establishment to a delegation server. By handing over the established security context to the constrained device, our delegation architecture significantly reduces the resource requirements of DTLS-protected communication for constrained devices. Additionally, our delegation architecture naturally provides authorization functionality when leveraging the central role of the delegation server in the initial connection establishment. Hence, in this paper, we present a comprehensive, yet compact solution for authentication, authorization, and secure data transmission in the IP-based IoT. The evaluation results show that compared to a public-key-based DTLS handshake our delegation architecture reduces the memory overhead by 64 %, computations by 97 %, network transmissions by 68 %.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to interconnect a myriad of devices. Emerging networking and backend support technology not only has to anticipate this dramatic increase in connected nodes, but also a change in traffic patterns. Instead of bulk data such as file sharing or multimedia streaming, IoT devices will primarily exchange real-time sensory and control data in small but numerous messages. Often cloud services will handle these data from a huge number of devices, and hence need to be extremely scalable to support conceivable large-scale IoT applications. To this end, we present a system architecture for IoT cloud services based on the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), which is primarily designed for systems of tiny, low-cost, resource-constrained IoT devices. Along with our system architecture, we systematically evaluate the performance of the new Web protocol in cloud environments. Our Californium (Cf) CoAP framework shows 33 to 64 times higher throughput than high-performance HTTP Web servers, which are the state of the art for classic cloud services. The results substantiate that the low overhead of CoAP does not only enable Web technology for lowcost IoT devices, but also significantly improves backend service scalability for vast numbers of connected devices.},

abstract={The proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) has fostered growing attention to real-time locating systems (RTLSs) using radio frequency identification (RFID) for asset management, which can automatically identify and track physical objects within indoor or confined environments. Various RFID indoor locating systems have been proposed. However, most of them are inappropriate for large-scale IoT applications owing to severe radio multipath, diffraction, and reflection. In this paper, we propose a newly fashioned RTLS using active RFID for the IoT, i.e., iLocate, which locates objects at high levels of accuracy up to 30 cm with ultralong distance transmission. To achieve fine-grained localization accuracy, iLocate presents the concept of virtual reference tags. To overcome signal multipath, iLocate employs a frequency-hopping technique to schedule RFID communication. To support large-scale RFID networks, iLocate leverages the ZigBee. We implement all hardware using 2.45-GHz RFID chips so that each active tag can communicate with readers that are around 1000 m away in a free space. Our empirical study and real project deployment show the superiority of the proposed system with respect to the localization accuracy and the data transmission rate for large-scale active RFID networks.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) allows connected objects to communicate via the Internet. IoT can benefit from the unlimited capabilities and resources of cloud computing. Also, when coupled with IoT, cloud computing can in turn deal with real world things in a more distributed and dynamic manner. As the cloud market becomes more open and competitive, Quality of Service (QoS) will be more important. However, cloud providers and cloud consumers have different, and sometimes opposite, preferences. If such a conflict occurs, a Service Level Agreement (SLA) cannot be reached without negotiation. A tradeoff negotiation approach can outperform a concession approach in terms of utility, but may incur more failures if information is incomplete. To balance utility and success rate, we propose a mixed approach for cloud service negotiation, which is based on the äóìgame of chicken.äó In particular, if one is uncertain about the strategy of its counterpart, it is best to mix concession and tradeoff strategies in negotiation. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, we conduct extensive simulations. Results show that a mixed negotiation approach can achieve a higher utility than a concession approach, while incurring fewer failures than a tradeoff approach.},

abstract={A Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is a key data provider for the Internet of Things (IoT). A WSN can serve as a tool for both identification and data generation. However, due to its inherent resource limitation the WSNs cannot generate and transmit large data streams and, therefore, typically transmit raw and simple sensor values. Furthermore, the sensors usually transmit their data in proprietary formats to an embedded application. This can be enough for WSN control and monitoring applications, but is not enough for the IoT where it is expected that thousands of different objects belonging to different context will be accessed remotely. In this work we propose to create a virtual representation of real objects (sensors) with a corresponding Virtual Object (VO) model. This VO produces not solely a stream of raw sensor measurements, but enriches those with context information. We evaluate our approach using a real city-scale traffic monitoring sensor network deployed in the city of Enschede, the Netherlands.},

abstract={The Internet of Things network is an application-driven network, being rapidly deployed across the world. It is expected to become a mega-scale network (connect billions of devices), and heterogeneous in terms of its sub-networks as well as enabling technologies. The data traffic communicated over this network is expected to be highly variable. It ranges from being the parameters being monitored about objects in this world (äóìthingsäó), e.g. temperature, to observations about a bigger environment, e.g. video surveillance of traffic. It may further vary from being critical data, to non-critical data. Accordingly, various issues related to packet delivery are of paramount importance. Especially for data related to safety-critical applications, and also urgent messaging, one needs to have a separate specific delivery scheme. In this paper, we propose a specialized delivery scheme for data that is of either urgent or critical nature, in the context of Internet of Things. The scheme is based on usage of byte-level error-correction codes, to improve relevant delivery parameters for such data. We have also simulated this scheme, and compared it with packet retransmission scheme for the perceived packet loss rate, and expected delivery latency. The simulation results show that our proposed scheme improves the transmission quality.},

abstract={The Internet of Things creates an environment where software systems are influenced and controlled by phenomena in the physical world. The goal is invisible and natural interactions with technology. However, if such systems are to provide a high-quality personalised service to individuals, they must by necessity gather information about those individuals. This leads to potential privacy invasion. Using techniques from Information Flow Control, data representing phenomena can be tagged with their privacy properties, allowing a trusted computing base to control access based on sensitivity and the system to reason about the flows of private data. For this to work well, tags must be assigned as soon as possible after phenomena are detected. Tagging within resource-constrained sensors raises worries that computing the tags may be too expensive and that useful tags are too large in relation to the data's size and the data's sensitivity. This paper assuages these worries, giving code templates for two small micro controllers (PIC and AVR) that effect meaningful tagging.},

abstract={Many applications for ad-hoc networks are based on a multicast communication paradigm, where a single source sends common data to many receivers. In these contexts, it is possible to efficiently secure the multicast communications by leveraging on a common secret key, denoted as äóìgroup keyäó, shared by multiple users. In this paper, we propose a novel centralized approach that efficiently addresses the problem of deriving and managing a group key in generic ad-hoc networks and Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios, reducing the computation overhead due to group membership changes caused by user's joins and leaves. In particular, the proposed method takes advantage of the assumption of two possible leave strategies: (i) at a pre-determined time interval selected when the member joins the group or (ii) at any unpredictable time interval, as in the case of membership revocation.},

The platform is developed under a cloud computing environment using context-oriented approaches. It collects sensor data from different types of sensor devices, including such as RFID, ZigBee sensors, GPS devices, temperature sensors, humidity sensors, luminance sensors, etc. First we are devoted to the study of deployment, management, and control of different types of sensors for automatic acquisition of sensor data and its related ambient information, both of which will be stored in the IoT repository in a cloud environment. Then, context-oriented mechanisms are developed to produce context data. With the devised context broker, the data retrieved from the IoT repository can be used to produce the contextual portfolio, which is annotated with semantic description. The contextual portfolio will then be stored into a cloud database as the User Portfolio. Finally, services for accessing the User Portfolio in the cloud are developed on a middleware platform, which is compliant with the OSGi standard. With the proposed platform, the acquired data is integrated into semantic contexts, which can be easily shared and reused among different mobile applications. Also, the context information can enhance mobile applications' usability by adapting to conditions that directly affect their operations.},

The proposed architecture integrates an intrusion detection system (IDS) into the network framework developed within the EU FP7 project ebbits. The aim is to detect DoS attacks based on 6LoWPAN. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed architecture, preliminary implementation was completed and tested against a real DoS attack using a penetration testing system. The paper concludes with the related results proving to be successful in detecting DoS attacks on 6LoWPAN. Further, extending the IDS could lead to detect more complex attacks on 6LoWPAN.},

abstract={Climate change and environmental monitoring and management have received much attention recently, and an integrated information system (IIS) is considered highly valuable. This paper introduces a novel IIS that combines Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud Computing, Geoinformatics [remote sensing (RS), geographical information system (GIS), and global positioning system (GPS)], and e-Science for environmental monitoring and management, with a case study on regional climate change and its ecological effects. Multi-sensors and Web services were used to collect data and other information for the perception layer; both public networks and private networks were used to access and transport mass data and other information in the network layer. The key technologies and tools include real-time operational database (RODB); extraction-transformation-loading (ETL); on-line analytical processing (OLAP) and relational OLAP (ROLAP); naming, addressing, and profile server (NAPS); application gateway (AG); application software for different platforms and tasks (APPs); IoT application infrastructure (IoT-AI); GIS and e-Science platforms; and representational state transfer/Java database connectivity (RESTful/JDBC). Application Program Interfaces (APIs) were implemented in the middleware layer of the IIS. The application layer provides the functions of storing, organizing, processing, and sharing of data and other information, as well as the functions of applications in environmental monitoring and management. The results from the case study show that there is a visible increasing trend of the air temperature in Xinjiang over the last 50 years (1962-2011) and an apparent increasing trend of the precipitation since the early 1980s. Furthermore, from the correlation between ecological indicators [gross primary production (GPP), net primary production (NPP), and leaf area index (LAI)] and meteorological elements (air temperature and precipitation), water resource availability is the decisi- e factor with regard to the terrestrial ecosystem in the area. The study shows that the research work is greatly benefited from such an IIS, not only in data collection supported by IoT, but also in Web services and applications based on cloud computing and e-Science platforms, and the effectiveness of monitoring processes and decision-making can be obviously improved. This paper provides a prototype IIS for environmental monitoring and management, and it also provides a new paradigm for the future research and practice; especially in the era of big data and IoT.},

Therefore, device-to-device (D2D) communication is expected to be an intrinsic part of the IoT. Devices will communicate with each other autonomously without any centralized control and collaborate to gather, share, and forward information in a multihop manner. The ability to gather relevant information in real time is key to leveraging the value of the IoT as such information will be transformed into intelligence, which will facilitate the creation of an intelligent environment. Ultimately, the quality of the information gathered depends on how smart the devices are. In addition, these communicating devices will operate with different networking standards, may experience intermittent connectivity with each other, and many of them will be resource constrained. These characteristics open up several networking challenges that traditional routing protocols cannot solve. Consequently, devices will require intelligent routing protocols in order to achieve intelligent D2D communication. We present an overview of how intelligent D2D communication can be achieved in the IoT ecosystem. In particular, we focus on how state-of-the-art routing algorithms can achieve intelligent D2D communication in the IoT.},

In this paper, we propose an Efficient Secure Lightweight RFID Authentication Scheme based on challenge-response model, named ESLRAS. To achieve authentication efficiency, the key of the tag is chosen to reduce the number of hash computing in database. Furthermore, the key is stored in database and updated constantly with the tag to prevent the tracking attack and the synchronization attack. The correctness of ESLRAS has been proved using GNY logic, and the performance of ESLRAS in terms of security and efficiency is evaluated. Compared with other existing approaches, ESLRAS achieves stronger security and higher efficiency.},

Use the anti-collision technology the IOT can prevent multiple tags simultaneously transmit data which causes collision. The current anti-collision algorithms are mainly Slotted ALOHA method and Binary Search method. The basic ALOHA algorithm has high current efficiency, but with the increase of the tags, the efficiency of the system will decrease greatly. This paper presented an improved ALOHA algorithm. In the proposed algorithm, the number of tags was estimated dynamically, with which a suitable size of window can be chosen to get higher system efficiency. At the same time, grouping strategy was introduced into the algorithm. The simulation results have shown that the proposed algorithm has higher system efficiency and lower working time.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) services and technologies become more and more predominant in the current and future era of the Internet. Lot of devices and applications are developed and connected to the classical IP networks. As for any new network services testing and evaluation is made in the intranet environment in these days. Neither the efficiency measurement methods of the energy usage nor communication nor sustainability aspects of these services have been determined exactly. Well defined solutions based on statistical analysis are needed to gather practical knowledge about the sensor based network nodes. The errors of the collected data arise in different levels of the process. There are errors during the measurement of a given signal by the sensor, another type of errors is generated during the transmission of collected data through the sensor access network, finally the store process of the received data influenced by errors as well. Evaluation of the hardware and software resource usage by the services and applications are very dissimilar tasks from the classical wired or wireless data network situations in case of IoT. Because of the data streams coming from quite a number of sensors, the statistical analysis of several dozens or hundreds of time series become a complex processing problem. The time series affected by errors generate a pre-processing challenge, which depends on several simultaneous aspects like the measured signal, the applied IoT communication technology and the data storing mechanism. The statistical analysis methods of the time series originated from the preliminary processing differ from the classical data network performance evaluation methods since in the IoT streams are grouped in epoch time periods, for instance. Having huge number of several variables distributed in time and physical space which describes special aspects of the measured and/or controlled system implies complex event processing. This paper presents a case study for th- complex data set which has been captured from 18 TFLOPS capacity supercomputer system with 1.5 thousand CPU cores.},

Existing statistical methods attempt to resolve the inconsistency, which requires adequate information to make decisions. Distributed consensus decision making (CDM) methods can provide an efficient and reliable means of synthesizing information by using a wider range of information than existing statistical methods. In this paper, we first discuss service composition for the IoT by minimizing the multi-parameter dependent matching value. Subsequently, a cluster-based distributed algorithm is proposed, whereby consensuses are first calculated locally and subsequently combined in an iterative fashion to reach global consensus. The distributed consensus method improves the robustness and trustiness of the decision process.},

abstract={A supply chain (SC) is a network of supplier, factories, warehouse, distribution centers, retailers, and customers, through which raw materials are acquired, transformed, produced, and delivered to the customers. As a complex network of suppliers, factories, warehouses, distributors, and retailers, the highly effective and efficient operations of a SC depend on the speedily moving of information flows and material flows. The rapid advances in information technology (IT) have always resulted in innovation, such as the Internet, that is terms of its potential as a channel for collecting, transmitting and storing information. As is well-known, the emergence of Internet has made a significant impact on the rapid growth of Internet-based information transfer between companies, their suppliers, and their customers. The Internet has emerged as an effective means of driving information integration and sharing for a supply chain, as well as has supported various coordination mechanisms across a supply chain. To make decisions promptly and to accelerate material flows via the integration and sharing of information flows improve the effectiveness and efficiency of a supply chain execution. However there exists a gap between the material flows and the information flows in a supply chain because of the information flows always can not reflect the wave of material flows real-timely, as well as it is impossible to understand the process of a supply chain execution real-timely. Being the next generation network of the Internet, the Internet of Things (IoT), which is a comprehensive extension of the Internet and also can achieve the pervasive connections between objects (things) and objects (things), information automotive collecting and real-time processing, as well as ubiquitous computing, close the gap between objects in the material world and their representation in information systems. It is able to real-timely monitor the process of a supply chain execution and also to further- - improve the efficiency and effectiveness of supply chain over the IoT. In this paper, the authors mainly discuss the characteristics of the IoT and enabling technologies, and explore the distributed architecture of SCM over the IoT.},

Our research finds direct applicability in the control of cyberphysical systems such as those present in networked unmanned vehicles, autonomous control of automobiles or real-time industrial process control, among other options. Using a real packet-based actuating testbed along with qualitative and quantitative experimental data we study the quality experienced by actual users.

The knowledge and information generated from wireless sensor nodes of the IoT make huge contributions to localization and tracking of targets with high mobility. This paper presents a square-root unscented Kalman filtering (SR-UKF) based localization and tracking algorithm for mobile target in an IoT environment. First, a localization initialization model is proposed for an IoT scenario. Then, according to information of neighboring sensor nodes, we employ the SR-UKF idea for the further localization and tracking of the target. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves lower localization and tracking error under the same computational complexity, compared with some conventional extended Kalman filtering (EKF) or UKF based methods. The proposed algorithm is of great significance in the field of IoT information processing.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) aims at connecting billions of devices in an Internet-like structure. This gigantic information exchange enables new opportunities and new forms of interactions among things and people. A crucial enabler of robust applications and easy smart objects' deployment is the availability of mechanisms that minimize (ideally, cancel) the need for external human intervention for configuration and maintenance of deployed objects. These mechanisms must also be scalable, since the number of deployed objects is expected to constantly grow in the next years. In this work, we propose a scalable and self-configuring peer-to-peer (P2P)-based architecture for large-scale IoT networks, aiming at providing automated service and resource discovery mechanisms, which require no human intervention for their configuration. In particular, we focus on both local and global service discovery (SD), showing how the proposed architecture allows the local and global mechanisms to successfully interact, while keeping their mutual independence (from an operational viewpoint). The effectiveness of the proposed architecture is confirmed by experimental results obtained through a real-world deployment.},

abstract={As computing technology becomes more tightly coupled into dynamic and mobile world of the Internet of Things (IoT), security mechanism becomes more stringent, less flexible and intrusive. Scalability issue in the IoT makes Identity Management (IdM) of ubiquitous things more challenging. Forming ad-hoc network, interaction between these nomadic devices to provide seamless service extend the need of new identities to the things, addressing and IdM in the IoT. New identities and identifier format to alleviate the performance issue is introduced in this paper. This paper presents novel Context-aware Clustering with Hierarchical Addressing (CCHA) scheme for the things with new identifier format. Simulation results shows that CCHA achieves better performance with less energy expenditure, less end-to-end delay and more throughput. Results also show that CCHA significantly reduces the failure probability. Furthermore, this paper also presents the framework for IdM in the IoT and mathematical model for queuing analysis.},

abstract={The IP-based Internet of Things refers to the pervasive interactions of smart objects and people enabling new applications by means of IP protocols. An application scenario is a Smart City in which the city infrastructure, cars, and people exchange information to enable new services. IP protocols, such as IPv6, TCP and HTTP will be further complemented by IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks and Constrained Application Protocol currently in development in IETF. Security and privacy are a must for the IP-based IoTs in order to ensure its acceptance. However, mobility, limited bandwidth, and resource-constrained devices pose new challenges and require for a sound and efficient security architecture. In particular, dynamic association of mobile smart objects and the management of keys in large-scale networks remain an open challenge. In this context, we propose a flexible security architecture based on the Host Identity Protocol and Multimedia Internet KEYing protocols allowing for secure network association and key management. HIP - based on asymmetric-key cryptography - ensures unambiguous thing identification, mobility support, as well as a lightweight and secure method for network association. In our solution, HIP is extended with MIKEY capabilities to provide enhanced key management using polynomials, which allow to generate pair wise keys with any node based on its identity. This combination of protocols and crypto-algorithms ensures both strong security and very good performance as shown by our implementation and presents clear advantages compared with other alternatives.},

abstract={Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) increasingly enable the interaction of the physical world with services, which may be located across the Internet from the sensing network. Cloud services and big data approaches may be used to store and analyse this data to improve scalability and availability, which will be required for the billions of devices envisaged in the Internet of Things (IoT). This potential of WSNs is limited by the relatively low number deployed and the difficulties imposed by their heterogeneous nature and limited (or proprietary) development environments and interfaces. This paper proposes a set of requirements for achieving a pervasive, integrated information system of WSNs and associated services. It also presents an architecture which provides a set of abstractions for the different types of sensors and services, enabling them to take advantage of Big Data and cloud technologies and which is termed holistic as it caters for the data flow from sensors through to services. The architecture has been designed for implementation on a resource constrained node and to be extensible to server environments, shown in this paper where we present a 'C' implementation of the core architecture, including services on Linux and Contiki (using the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)) and a Linux service to integrate with the Hadoop HBase data store.},

abstract={Machine to Machine communication will play an important role in enabling the Internet of Things. Devices in both home and industrial settings will cooperate to create smart spaces. Devices will communicate with each other autonomously, enabling them to make decisions to reach an optimal environmental goal. The nature of their deployment will involve these devices having to operate under extreme conditions, such as during a fire, flooding or following an explosion. Events such as these would usually cause a reduction in the number of devices that originally constituted the system. Individual device loss might be temporary or permanent. Devices might not be active at the time of failure and may be sleeping due to the low power requirements to extend device longevity. It is important that when devices wake they can obtain the information they require and if a device is destroyed that its last known state is preserved in the system. Preserving the last know state of a device also provides a useful source of information for post failure analysis as well as the continued operation of the system during the event. This paper details our rendezvous state redundancy protocol for the Internet of Things. We then validate the use of position relative topologies when creating distributed hash tables for redundancy in wireless mesh IoT sensor networks. We then provide an evaluation of the keying mechanism used to provide optimal redundancy for given failure patterns.},

The data generated by the Internet of Things are valuable and have the potential to drive innovative and novel applications. The data streams coming from these devices will challenge the traditional approaches to data management and contribute to the emerging paradigm of big data. One of the most challenging tasks before collecting and processing data from these devices (e.g. sensors) is discovering and configuring the sensors and the associated data streams. In this paper, we propose a tool called SmartLink that can be used to discover and configure sensors. Specifically, SmartLink, is capable of discovering sensors deployed in a particular location despite their heterogeneity (e.g. different communication protocols, communication sequences, capabilities). SmartLink establishes the direct communication between the sensor hardware and cloud-based IoT middleware. We address the challenge of heterogeneity using a plugin architecture. Our prototype tool is developed on the Android platform. We evaluate the significance of our approach by discovering and configuring 52 different types of Libelium sensors.},

In this vision, the IoT foresees novel types of applications dynamically finding the associations between devices and EoIs around a common feature of interest (e.g. temperature of a room) to provide meaningful information as well as rich services to users about the things they are interested in. Growing interest in providing sensors and actuators has led to billions of services or data offered through different platforms, some of them wrapped with semantic descriptions to realize aforementioned associations through accurate search processes. However, due to the ubiquitous aspect of the IoT and the potential mobility of the devices that enable it, a centralized approach does not allow designing scalable processes to efficiently search and manage these associations or the devices and EoIs that compose them. As location seems to be an important parameter when searching the IoT, we believe that designing a framework composed of geographically distributed nodes with local reasoning capabilities is a much more scalable approach to realize the IoT vision. We describe our approach of such vision by creating a federated network composed of such nodes that declare their location based on a formal model. In this vision, each node is capable of processing semantic descriptions of devices or EoIs to share deduced associations with other peers that are selected based on their location nearness.},

Research works are dealing with technologies that enable the so-called things to communicate among them and with users in order to provide data and/or accomplish tasks. This scenario is posing several challenges so that more and more researchers are dealing with them. Our work deals with the definition of both machine and human understandable descriptions of things by means of ontologies in order to enable the collaboration among physical objects and IT systems. Indeed, recent works highlighted how the IoT technology may be profitably used in several scenarios in order to accomplish complex tasks where physical objects are active participants. First, we extend the Semantic Sensor Network ontology defined by the W3C Semantic Sensor Networks Incubator Group with concepts and roles that describe actuators. This leads to the definition of a comprehensive Internet of Things ontology. Then, with the support from domain experts, we analyze the earthquake emergency scenario in order to define for it a domain ontology by means of adding domain-related concepts to the IoT ontology. Furthermore, we compare our work with others that use ontologies to formally describes things.},

Such pieces are then streamed by a DASH client from a typical HTTP server through a CCN network. HTTP/CCN adapters are used to translate the HTTP requests to CCN interests and HTTP responses to CCN content objects. The results are promising, the experiment demonstrated that CCN can fit into IoT environments and that its integrated caching mechanisms will highly reduce the necessary time to retrieve content, specifically streamed video, therefore increasing network efficiency.},

This paradigm has the potential to revolutionize global industry and daily life. Healthcare is once such industry where the Internet of Things may provide great advantages to patients, care givers, and medical institutions. As the number of radio frequency emitters increases under this new paradigm public health and safety must also be taken into account. This paper explores the electromagnetic interference on implantable cardiac rhythm management devices caused by RFID interrogators. A standard electromagnetic compatibility test framework is proposed in order to diagnose the possibility of interference. Also, a mitigation method is proposed and tested. It is shown that the proposed method can reduce the incidence of clinically significant interference by nearly 60%.},

abstract={Prognoses predict the number of smart devices building the Internet of Things (IoT) to range between 30 and 50 billions in 2020, in the most conservative outlook triplicating today's numbers of devices connected to the Internet in just 7 years. While hardware developments and new standards for network and application protocols are progressing well, there is little consensus about how such heterogeneous, wide-scale networks should be planned, administrated and integrated with traditional networks, but also with cloud based infrastructure in a holistic, end-to-end fashion. Thousands of different vendor hardware and software options and incompatible technological lifecycle time spans for smart things will result in serious challenges for device orchestration, management and network scaling. The framework for data collection, transmission and storage has already been raised as an elementary question when aspects of social acceptance and regulatory transparency are being discussed. In this paper we propose a basic, holistic categorization model for devices building the IoT which aims at addressing some of the challenges described by introducing an universal, simple, high-level labeling scheme which contains different flags specifying possible application or use cases, data flow and storage options, economic and ecologic parameters as well as management and control elements.},

Current spatial index trees are mostly not efficient for query data collection and aggregation. To address this challenge, we propose in this paper an Energy efficiency index tree (EGF-tree) for efficient data collection and aggregation, especially for the situation when sensor nodes are distributed unevenly. Generally, the region of the sensor network is divided evenly into grid cells. An EGF-tree is constructed through merging grid cells nearby. A multi-region query aggregation method is proposed for facilitating the collection and aggregation of simultaneous queries. Theoretical analysis and experiments show that our query aggregation technique is energy efficient.},

So by utilizing the relay devices, the scheme not only imposes light computation and communication costs on terminal nodes, improves the algorithm complexity, but also authenticates the relay devices indirectly and recessively, thus protecting the terminal nodes and relay devices from being cracked. The modified elliptic mapping scheme is introduced in the authentication and key update mechanisms. Through security analysis, it is shown that the scheme is secure, feasible and highly effective compared with the Public Key Cryptosystem for the typical Multi-Hop Relay networks.},

The underneath idea is that every object can look for the desired service using its friendships, in a distributed manner. However, in the resulting network, every object will still have to manage a large number of friends, slowing down the search of the services.

In this article, a method to couple objects, the Things, to the Internet is suggested. The solution uses virtual representations of objects by using low-cost, passive RFID tags to give objects identities on the Internet. A prototype that maps an RFID identity into an IPv6 address is constructed. It is illustrated how this approach can be used in access control systems based on open network protocols and packet filtering. The solution includes a novel RFID reader architecture that supports the internetworking of components of a future access control system based on network layer technology.},

abstract={Research and development of mobile information systems in the Future Internet of Things is about delivering technologies built around management and access to real-time heterogeneous datasets. Analyzing these enormous volumes of disparate data on mobile devices requires context-aware smart applications and services. 3DQ (Three Dimensional Query) is our novel mobile spatial interaction (MSI) prototype for data mining and analysis on today's location and orientation aware äóìsmartphonesäó within such 3D sensor web environments. Our application tailors a military style threat dome query calculation using MSI with äóìhidden query removaläó functionality to reduce information overload and heighten situation awareness on these commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) devices. Allied MSI research into the information overload problem is ongoing, where map personalisation and other semantic based filtering mechanisms are essential to de-clutter and adapt the exploration of the real world to the processing/display limitations of mobile devices. We propose that another way to filter this information is to intelligently refine the search space. The combined effect gives a more accurate and expected query (search) result for Location-Based Services (LBS) applications by returning information on only those objects/sensor enabled äóìthingsäó visible within a user's 3D field-of-view (FOV) as they move through a built environment.},

abstract={Embedded systems are omnipresent in our daily lives and rapidly gaining more and more importance, with performance improvements and technological evolutions in several directions. One of the most promising directions of evolution is in their interconnection. Already today there is a broad variety of use cases for interconnected embedded systems (automobiles, airplanes, automated production halls, etc.) and the most cutting edge examples demand the distributed embedded systems to tightly couple their operation. As a direct result of this tight coupling, stringent requirements on the underlying communication network immediately arise. The Internet-of-Things (IoT) as a discipline and movement to systematically connect distributed embedded systems on large or even Internet-like scales, promises a new generation of systems and system-of-systems. In order to also enable tight coupling of embedded systems in the IoT, there is a need for deterministic communication channels with predictable and low communication latency and jitter. In this paper we discuss how synchronous deterministic channels can be developed for the IoT by application of the time-triggered communication paradigm and other technology standards currently under development.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) aims to connect the growing number of sensing and monitoring devices to humans or other devices with the goal of exchanging data or controlling these devices. IoT can be considered as the set of technologies that allow small devices e.g. sensors, which constitute wireless sensor networks (WSNs) that perform specific tasks, to communicate over the Internet Protocol (IP). Cellular networks, especially LTE, are an attractive technology to provide Internet connectivity to these potentially remote devices. In order to allow the cellular networks to connect these devices reliably to the Internet, the traffic of WSNs should be studied to understand their unique requirements on the cellular infrastructure. This is because the existing cellular networks have been traditionally designed mainly to support human to human communication in which case the traffic is completely different than that of WSNs. This paper aims to shed some light on the possible integration challenges that are imposed by the integration of WSNs and LTE which manifest themselves in the difference in traffic characteristics. We perform some experiments to explore the behavior of specific WSN application traffic. We then discuss the possible adaptation that is required for the successfully integration of the two technologies.},

abstract={The Internet of Things scales the Internet to billions of embedded nodes and allows to link physical and cyber systems to form complex control systems. Current research focuses mainly on the networking and communication protocols and leaves the application layer and aspects like the engineering process and creation of control logic out of scope. Existing approaches are mainly based on using scripting languages to create control logic for the Internet of Things, which is a problem for nontechnical users. This paper presents oBeliX which is a generic user interface and graphical control logic editor for the Internet of Things. The system requirements to enable a scripting-free creation of control logic are stated and a concrete system fulfilling these requirements together with a proof of concept implementation and evaluation are presented.},

abstract={Facilitating the creation of Internet of Things (IoT) applications is a major concern to increase its development. D-LITe, our previous work, is a framework for that purpose. In D-LITe, Objects are considered as part of a whole application. They offer a REST web service that describes Object capabilities, receives the logic to be executed, and interacts with other stakeholders. Then, the complete application is seen as a choreography dynamically deployed on various objects. But the main issue of choreographies is the loss of coherence. Because of their unreliability, some networks used in IoT may introduce de-synchronization between Objects, leading to errors and failures. In this paper, we propose a solution to re-introduce coherence in the application, in order to keep the advantages of choreography while dealing with this main issue. An overlay of logical check-points at the application layer defines links between the coherent states of a set of objects and triggers re-synchronization messages. Correcting statements are thus spread through the network, which enables fault recovery in Choreographies. This paper ends with a comparison between the checking cost and the reliability improvement.},

Huge amount of information is expected to be generated, raising at the same time significant concerns: the generated information has to be organized in a meaningful way that facilitates the development of a variety of applications, and it should be protected against unauthorized access.

Within this scenario, we focus on the problem of understanding how the information provided by members of the social IoT has to be processed so as to build a reliable system on the basis of the behavior of the objects. We define two models for trustworthiness management starting from the solutions proposed for P2P and social networks. In the subjective model each node computes the trustworthiness of its friends on the basis of its own experience and on the opinion of the friends in common with the potential service providers. In the objective model, the information about each node is distributed and stored making use of a distributed hash table structure so that any node can make use of the same information. Simulations show how the proposed models can effectively isolate almost any malicious nodes in the network at the expenses of an increase in the network traffic for feedback exchange.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IOT) has recently become popular to emphasize the vision of a global infrastructure of networked physical objects. The service framework based on IOT global infrastructure can provide full context resources and transform everyday objects into smart objects that automatically understand and react to their environment. However, the framework is still lacking because of unclear structural standards in IOT. In this paper, we construct an intelligent decision-making service framework based on the general IOT global structure and explicitly define its components' function and which IOT layer it belongs to. As to key problem of the frameworkhow to make intelligent decision depended on the context, we propose a QoS model according to improved Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). We use hierarchical clustering algorithm, fuzzy comprehensive evaluation, scale-extending method, entropy weight method, etc. to overcome AHP's inherent defects such as subjectivity. In the end, we perform a simulation to verify our study results, which reflects that the service decision-making controller in our framework can promptly evaluate available services and select the best service for users with the model.},

abstract={The internet of things (IoT) is a network to realize interconnects between almost any object and web services. It can be applied in many domains, such as radio frequency identification (RFID), wireless sensor network(WSN) and so on. The application of IoT brings us the higher efficiency and the more convenient life. In this paper, we propose a new IoT application framework to search the optimal routes for the ambulances with taking into account the effects for the traffic in the ambulance running time. In this system, with the help of the RFID tags in the ambulances and wireless sensor nodes on the roads, the dispatch control center in the hospital can collect the real-time traffic conditions where wireless sensor nodes locates. The report messages are sent to the control center by the multi-hop method. Based on the information coming from sensor nodes, the control center forecasts the optical path to provide the fastest route for the ambulances. In this decision process, the control center will ignore some information from the nodes, which have higher traffic jam than the average. Experimental results show that our system can provide the best route to the ambulances. And it also has the more potential applications in wide areas.},

abstract={The last decade saw the emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm, which aims to connect any object to the Internet. As in IoT networks, the radio component is usually the main source of energy depletion, specific medium access control protocols have been designed to reduce its usage. Among those, X-MAC has gained much interest in recent years, and has become one of the most popular MAC protocols in the IoT community due to its many theoretical advantages. X-MAC is a preamble-sampling protocol based on the low power listening mechanism, in which the nodes decide their schedule independently from their neighbors. So far, no study has ever identified malfunctions that appear in the protocol design. In addition, performance evaluations were only made through theoretical studies and simulations, or relatively limited scale experiments. In this paper, we point out several omissions and black spots that appear in the original protocol design and that lead to encountering severe underachievements. We also provide explanations to these flaws and propose solutions that solve or at least reduce their impact. Finally, we have led a thorough experimental campaign on an indoor static grid composed of 240 nodes. From those studies, we quantify the performances of the original X-MAC design and the impact of our improvements.},

Since WSN can both sense the environment and apply algorithms to process the data, more real-time and useful information can be gathered from the physical world than using traditional sensing systems. These networks can also be integrated into the ""Internet of Things"" in order to allow collaboration and wider access to sensor data.

Our research finds direct applicability in the control of cyberphysical systems such as those present in networked unmanned vehicles, autonomous control of automobiles or realtime industrial process control, among other options. Using a real packet-based actuating testbed along with qualitative and quantitative experimental data we study the quality experienced by actual users.

These Smart Objects are providing an enormous quantity of data. This work is focused on the personal and mobile health areas, where the integration of clinical devices in the patient's environment, this will enable new services with capabilities to predict health anomalies in real time, send alerts, reminders and offer an enriched feedback to the patient. This feedback will help and motivate to the patients with the treatments adherence and compliance and to follow a healthy lifestyle. In order to reach these services and feedback capabilities, it is required a full integration of the clinical devices and efficient processing of the collected data.

What is the next äóìrevolutionäó that will bring a new wave of productivity gain? Our answer is äóìInternet of Things (IoT)äó also called äóìIndustrial Internetäó. It consists of intelligent devices, intelligent systems, and intelligent decisioning that allow the physical world of machines, facility, fleets and networks to more deeply merge with the connectivity, big data and analytics of the digital world. With IoT, all things in the world link and communicate with each other. They have their identities, physical attributes, and interfaces. They are seamlessly integrated into the information network such that they become active participants in business, information and social processes wherever and whenever needed and proper. They can interact among themselves and with the environment by exchanging data and information `sensed' about the environment, while reacting autonomously to the events by triggering actions and creating services with or without direct human intervention. What are the proper architectures for such IoT? How can one implement them? What are the technical challenges? What are the existing applications showing the promise of IoT? This talk intends to answer these questions and lead the audience to an exciting field of IoT and their various applications including environmental monitoring, intelligent transportation systems and smart grids.},

One key technology for implementing the above concepts is how to realize the effective quantitative evaluation of ESER. In this paper, the existing ESER evaluation technology and systems are summarized first. It is found that the existing ESER evaluation technology and systems are almost isolated from the existing enterprise information systems, such as enterprise resource planning (ERP), product data management (PDM), and customer relationship management (CRM), which results in the expanding of the enterprise information islands. In order to address this problem, a new method for ESER life cycle assessment (LCA) based on Internet of Things (IoT) and bill of material (BOM) is proposed in this paper. A four-layered structure (i.e., perception access layer, data layer, service layer, and application layer) ESER LCA system based on IoT and BOM is designed and presented, as well as the key technologies and the functions in each layer. A prototype application system is developed to validate the proposed method. The main contributions of the proposed method are: 1) facilitate real-time intelligent perception, and the collection of energy consumption and environmental impact data generated in the entire life cycle of manufacturing by using IoT technologies; and 2) realize effective data integration between the ESER evaluation system and the existing enterprise information systems based on BOM.},

abstract={With the emergence of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology and Electronic Product Code (EPC) standard, physical objects attached with the RFID tags can be uniquely identified and traced on the global trading network. Under the new paradigm of the Internet of Things (IoT), RFID becomes an importantly enabling technology. However, there is a limitation in object tracking in the Internet: if the object changes the location, the previously assigned IP is no longer valid. In this paper, we propose an approach, named Distributed RFID Postal Tracking System, to make the RFID-tagged mails traceable and accessible by assigning an IPv6 Mapped EPC address. With the implementation of location-update mechanism in the system, each mail can be still accessed although it changes the location. The proposed approach is based on structured Peer-to-Peer (P2P) overlay, which is formed by the RFID readers, and mails' accessing information is distributed over the P2P network. Under the support of P2P network, we not only combine the RFID-tagged objects with the Internet, but also make the system achieve scalability, robustness and high efficiency in system operations for the IoT.},

abstract={The forthcoming Internet of Things - an intelligent collaboration of resource-limited static/mobile devices that are embedded in the daily lives of users - poses new challenges to security and end-user privacy. One of the most challenging problems is how to thwart replica attacks. Once a device is captured physically by an attacker or contaminated by malicious code, it can be reprogrammed and the secret information inside can be duplicated into a large number of replicas that maliciously occupy the network and collect users private information without authorisation. In this study, the authors focus on studying the detection of replicas in mobile applications; which can consist of resource-limited static devices attached to mobile entities. Most existing solutions for detecting replicas have been designed for static devices, and cannot be immediately applied to mobile devices because of their unique properties, in particular, their node mobility. The authors present two efficient methods for detecting replicas in mobile devices. Through performance evaluations, they find that the proposed methods provide highly accurate replica detection with nearly zero detection errors. Furthermore, the distributed and cooperative strategy of the methods significantly reduces the energy required to detect replicas while providing faster replica detection than the existing solutions.},

abstract={RFID technology and the Internet of Things provide a flood of information which can be regarded as a stream of complex events. The most acute complex event data management challenges today stem from organizations which rely on a large number of diverse, interrelated data sources, but with difficulties of managing their event data in a unified, integrated and correlated way. It is because ,up until now, there is no standard data stream query language and the fundamental questions in connection with data models and formal semantics for stream queries have not yet been thoroughly addressed. In this paper, we present the design of a framework named HEP which integrates the representation of two typical categories of event streams (relational and XML event streams). Our framework supports unified event fusing and processing with a general window specification that can be used to express almost all types of windows of which we are aware, and is semantically clear and easy to understand. It can be extended to new types of windows that may occur in the future for some new IoT applications. We provide a real case prototype implementation, and experiments show the usefulness and effectiveness of our method.},

To ensure the reliability of end-to-end transmission through the hierarchical networks, fault management is of great importance. Current relative fault detection algorithms are designed for specified network, not suited to this complex communication environment. In this paper, we propose a layered fault management scheme for IoT with uniform observing points setting around. In order to distinguish between the real fault and false alarm, fuzzy cognitive maps theory is introduced to set up the monitoring model. By adjusting the weighting rules in the model, different observing points may realize flexible judgment of the link failure risk in their authorities. After locating the fault roots, original recovery method for individual networks may be used to rescue the broken transmission. The distributed working mode makes the proposed scheme more efficient and strong. This design may both realize quick fault discovery and use the existing implementation to the maximum extent. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

abstract={RFID readers of various organizations deployed in the Internet of Things environment are interconnected for service data relay, however heterogeneous readers' forward strategies increases routing failure and routing overhead. Our main contribution is to propose a novel small world based routing protocol. Distributed hubs are generated by shared peer statuses so that a logical small world is constructed. Hence a long-distance route path is split to a proactive short intra-clique segment, a proactive long inter-clique segment and a reactive short intra-clique segment. The proactive segments are logically shortened by hub strategy exchange, therefore routing discover overhead is greatly reduced; intermediate nodes select a path to the destination hub with the greatest utility function so that the reachability of recent data flow is guaranteed. Moreover, a tagged-AODV routing protocol is employed in intra-clique routing to avoid routing failure caused by restrict strategies. Our simulation results show that the tagged small world approach is efficient in dynamic networks, compared to regular AODV and tagged-AODV protocols it reduces routing overhead and improves routing success rate significantly.},

With this technology, novel RFID and sensor devices, so-called organic smart labels, will be printed like today's newspaper at high speed and in large amounts. This approach promises a dramatically cost reduction while providing on-label sensors. Because of that, organic smart labels are expected to find a broad adoption where current passive and active RFID technologies have failed. For instance, in the context of the Internet-of-Things (IoT), organic smart labels enable item-level tracking and in-depth sensory monitoring of real-world objects over the Internet. In this article, we set a business related perspective in correspondence with a technological roadmap of the organic smart label development. Furthermore, we discuss technical problems that will arise when processing the huge amount of data expected from the usage of organic smart labels.},

Low energy consumption version of TESLA is ‘_TESLA, which is designed for wireless sensor network (WSN), while cannot tolerate DoS attack. TESLA++ is the DoS-tolerant version and is designed for VANET. TESLA++ cannot be accepted by WSN because of its higher consumption of power. To realize secure and robust DoS attack in the hybrid-vehicle-sensor network, we provide a TESLA-based protocol against DoS attack with a lower consumption of power. Analysis results demonstrate that using our protocol is better than using ‘_TESLA or TELSA++, respectively.},

The desirable attributes of such a microcontroller and the like include high energy and area efficiency, and robust error-free operation under dynamic voltage scaling (DVS), workload, process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variation effects. In this work, a synchronous-logic (<i>S</i> 8051) and a quasi-delay-insensitive asynchronous-logic (<i>A</i> 8051) 8051 microcontroller core are designed and fabricated for full-range DVS from nominal <i>VDD</i> to deep sub-threshold. The performance of the <i>S</i> 8051 and <i>A</i> 8051 are largely comparable at nominal conditions and the entire DVS range, but differs when PVT and workload are varied. At nominal <i>VDD</i>, both the microcontroller cores feature comparable energy and speed, with the electromagnetic interference of the <i>A</i> 8051 ~ 12 dB lower and the area ~ 2 í„ larger than the <i>S</i> 8051. When DVS is applied, both the microcontroller cores feature comparable energy and speed; the <i>S</i> 8051 requires simultaneous adjustment of clock frequency with <i>VDD</i>. At wide PVT variations, up to ~ 12 í„ delay margins are required for the <i>S</i> 8051, whereas the <i>A</i> 8051 operates at actual speed. When the workload of both microcontrollers is varied, the <i>A</i> 8051 features lower energy dissipation per workload due to the exploitation of its asynchronous-logic protocols. For IoT applications that incur wide PVT and workload variations, <i>A</i> 8051 is more suitable due to its self-timed nature, whereas when PVT and workload variations are less severe, <i>S</i> 8051 is more suitable due to a smaller IC area.},

abstract={Social networks connect people while internet of things platforms connect things. Although both platforms use various communication tools in efficient ways, platforms for things often don't communicate and interoperate with social networks. As a consequence, there is a lack of unified programming interfaces and platforms to enable internet-based interactions between people and things. This hinders deployment of services where people and things need to co-exist such as in ambient assisted living and collaborative sensing scenarios. We propose activity feeds as a unified communication framework to address this integration challenge. The activity feed concept is widely deployed in social networks and recently also in internet of things platforms. It is a flexible and easy-to-understand concept. We propose a communication framework based on activity feeds consisting of a set of concepts, a set of patterns for using activity feeds, an API for developing applications, and a reference implementation of the framework on smart phones. We describe how we tested this framework in two different applications in the areas of ambient assisted living and crisis management. For these two applications we were able to easily deploy the framework by invoking the activity feed API. We report on how we use communication patterns based on activity feeds and how the framework managed to facilitate people and thing communication.},

abstract={Presently, middleware technologies abound for the Internet-of-Things (IoT), directed at hiding the complexity of underlying technologies and easing the use and management of IoT resources. The middleware solutions of today are capable technologies, which provide much advanced services and that are built using superior architectural models, they however fail short in some important aspects: existing middleware do not properly activate the link between diverse applications with much different monitoring purposes and many disparate sensing networks that are of heterogeneous nature and geographically dispersed. Then, current middleware are unfit to provide some system-wide global arrangement (intelligence, routing, data delivery) emerging from the behaviors of the constituent nodes, rather than from the coordination of single elements, i.e. self-organization. This paper presents the SIMPLE self-organized and intelligent middleware platform. SIMPLE middleware innovates from current state-of-research exactly by exhibiting self-organization properties, a focus on data-dissemination using multi-level subscriptions processing and a tiered networking approach able to cope with many disparate, widespread and heterogeneous sensing networks (e.g. WSN). In this way, the SIMLE middleware is provided as robust zero-configuration technology, with no central dependable system, immune to failures, and able to efficiently deliver the right data at the right time, to needing applications.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) develops rapidly and becomes a hot topic around the world now. After analyzing and comparing the current IoT layer models, a three-dimension (3D) technology model is proposed to classify the complicated IoT technologies logically for the existing IoT. Furthermore, U2IoT (Unit IoT and Ubiquitous IoT) model is summarized and the layer model is updated by adding social layer for the future IoT. Based on this, whether IoT can be regarded as an emerging industrial or a new major is answered. After studying the related issues, this paper argues that IoT is inappropriate to be an independent industry while it should be regarded as a new thing at the stage of intelligentization and informatization development for all walks of life. Meanwhile, how to train talents in colleges is also a problem to be explored. After analyzing how IoT relates to the science system and why setting IoT major for undergraduate is different with other majors setting, this paper proposes two modes to set IoT major and gives some suggestions for universities on the related IoT major problem in China as well.},

abstract={The management of smart objects (SObjs) is an important task because they are huge in number and applications. Such huge number of SObjs may lead the Internet of Things (IoT) to face severe network conditions, in terms of network congestion and large delays. Thus, the management of SObjs is fundamental to avoid future IoT network problems. In such a management, network boxes, also called gateways, have been configured to manage SObjs with software updates or reconfiguration followed by a warm start. However, gateways configuration become soon outdated because SObjs join and leave the network quite frequently. Therefore, we propose an approach called MbDSAS to reconfigure gateways without the need of a software updating or patching to manage and detect SObjs and deal with the dynamicity of the IoT network. An evaluation of MbDSAS was performed through an airport modeled scenario. In addition, MbDSAS was experimentally tested to be qualified as a management solution to IoT scenarios and to determine the best performance combination of technologies to implement MbDSAS.},

In order to ensure the security of sensitive data transmitted between the nodes, and access permission control for the sensing node, a pair of encryption nodes-encryption sensing node and access control node are designed based on AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm, and AES security coprocessor of CC2530 is used. The 128-bit key for AES is generated by Hash function whose inputs are fingerprint feature data coming from fingerprint module. Different fingerprint feature data can generate many keys to form a key bank. According to the access permission for different users, the administrator can allocate these keys to different nodes to form a sub-key bank. Keys in sub-key bank can be updated dynamically. The designed encryption node can manage the access permission and implement the user authentication. The software and hardware design methods of the encryption node are presented. The data transmission experiments between the nodes are carried out. The results show that the encryption nodes can achieve wireless encryption transmission for the node's data, so its security can be ensured.},

abstract={This paper explores some a novel approaches to harnessing the Internet-of-Things (IoT) as a teaching and research vehicle in education. For teaching we argue that the Internet-of-Things provides a highly motivating topic to capture students' imaginations, and a perfect platform for teaching computer science. In addition, we explain the potential for entire campuses or buildings to be constructed from Internet-of-Things technologies and the potential for this infrastructure to act as a teaching platform. This proposition is perfectly captured by the axiom ""The college building (or campus) is the lab"". This philosophy is part of a wider movement that started in the EU, called Living Labs. In achieving these aims, our work seeks to combine a number of concepts, first we utilise the Internet-of-Things, second we incorporate Living Labs ideas, third we harness the iCampus vision, forth we use the 'Smart Box' concept and finally we implement the Pervasive-interactive-Programming (PiP) paradigm. We contend this approach can be used in various mixes to produce highly motivating and effective educational environments. We illustrate this work by describing the application of these ideas to a real-world venture, the Harlow UTC (in the UK). The main focus of this paper concerns the use of PiP, together with the Internet-of-Things, to teach elementary programming skills. In in support of this we present results of an evaluation of PiP with 18 participants (students and staff) of varied age and gender. The main conclusions of these evaluations were that PiP enabled students and staff, with diverse backgrounds, to quickly master the programming skills involved. The paper concludes by describing our future plans for this work.},

We evaluate the proposed system architecture using a prototype built from commercially available single board computers, sensors, and actuators. The software components of the system are selected from open source, free software, for example, we use Linux, QEMU, python, etc. on the prototype.

For MASs to achieve higher popularity among end-users, we believe that agent oriented software engineering (AOSE) should adopt a new paradigm as has been done in Web 2.0 - to allow end-users to actively participate in developing or modifying features in agents at various stages of the agent's lifecycle. In this paper, we propose a vision for democratizing AOSE.

Meanwhile the communication layer should try to lower the overhead. Therefore a highly efficient design for a socket server with buffer pool and a thread pool for concurrent request on the IOT platform is presented. This reduces the system overhead and buffer usage to the largest extent while faced with a large number of connections and digital requests. The simulation shows that a socket server with a thread pool and buffer pool could lower the overhead on the context switch of threads as well as the I/O blocking. This creates and destroys threads so as to energize the system.},

abstract={Networks of smart resource-constrained objects, such as sensors and actuators, can support a wide range of application domains. In most cases these networks were proprietary and stand-alone. More recently, many efforts have been undertaken to connect these networks to the Internet using standard protocols. Current solutions that integrate smart resource-constrained objects into the Internet are mostly gateway-based. In these solutions, security, firewalling, protocol translations and intelligence are implemented by gateways at the border of the Internet and the resource-constrained networks. In this paper, we introduce a complementary approach to facilitate the realization of what is called the Internet of Things. Our approach focuses on the objects, both resource-constrained and non-constrained, that need to cooperate by integrating them into a secured virtual network, named an Internet of Things Virtual Network or IoTVN. Inside this IoT-VN full end-to-end communication can take place through the use of protocols that take the limitations of the most resource-constrained devices into account. We describe how this concept maps to several generic use cases and, as such, can constitute a valid alternative approach for supporting selected applications. A first implementation demonstrating the key concepts of this approach is described. It illustrates the feasibility of integrating resource-constrained devices into virtual networks, but also reveals open challenges.},

Thirty years ago, the idea of 'Connecting Every-Thing' was just a topic of science fiction, but with the introduction and technological advancements and introduction of the Internet, the fiction has become reality. Up to now, communications systems, and also the Internet, have predominantly been used by and for individuals. With loT we all experience a domain shift towards connected devices and machines - the Things - which are autonomously requesting and supplying information via networks. This development leads to a series of great challenges not only for future technology and its standardization, but also for the whole of society. This talk will focus on one of the absolutely critical aspects within the loT environment - communications. Communications are required at every level, from a tiny sensor device ranging up to a high performance data center on a backbone. Today's new requirements regarding technology, reliability and standards will be reviewed, and some conjectures will be given on where advanced communications might take us and the loT in the future.},

abstract={Recent research endeavours are capitalizing on state of the art technologies to build a scalable Internet of Things (IoT). Envisioned as a technology to integrate the best of Wireless Sensor Networks and RFID systems, there is much promise for a global network of objects that are identifiable, track-able, and harmoniously informing. However, the realization of an IoT framework is hindered by many factors, the most pressing of which is attributed to the integration of these heterogeneous nodes and devices. A considerable subset of these nodes undergoes movement and dynamically enters and leaves the network backbone/topology. Routing packets and inter-nodal communication has received little attention; mainly due to the sheer reliance on the Internet as a backbone. However, spatially correlated entities in the IoT, and those which most often interact, would pose a significant overhead of communication if all intermediate packets need to be routed over distant backhauls. In remedy, we present a Pruned Adaptive IoT Routing (PAIR) protocol that selectively establishes routes of communication between IoT nodes. Since nodes in the IoT belong to different owners, we also introduce a pricing model to cater for the exchange of monetary costs by intermediate nodes to utilize their relaying resources. We also establish a cap on inter-nodal routing to dynamically utilize the Internet backbone if the source to destination distance surpasses a preset (case optimized) threshold. The PAIR routing protocol is elaborated upon, building upon the detailed system model presented in this paper. We finally present a use case to demonstrate the utility and practicality of PAIR in the heterogeneous IoT as it scales.},

IoT is understood to bring along multiple technological challenges. These should not be considered in isolation, since IoT is characterized by the introduction of machine to machine applications with no or minimal human involvement, and the high pervasiveness of the technological artefacts realizing it. The technological developments shaping the IoT vision are manifesting in multiple economic sectors, including computing, telecommunications, construction and logistics---to name a few. Among the various technological developments supporting the IoT, wireless networking, embedded computing and scalable computation through virtualization are considered the key driving forces for transforming the IoT vision into reality. Herein we present the IoT vision and elaborate on key technological developments in these pivotal thematic areas. We conclude the paper with insights drawn from this survey of technological developments and sketch out directions for future research.},

This makes the trust management in IoT more promising to address the access control issues .This paper present a Fuzzy approach to the Trust Based Access Control (FBAC) with the notion of trust levels for identity management. The presented fuzzy approach for trust calculations deals with the linguistic information of devices to address access control in the IoT. The simulation result shows that the fuzzy approach for trust based access control guarantees scalability ad it is energy efficient.

In this paper, we focus on protecting the sensor's location by introducing suitable modifications to sensor routing to make it difficult for an eavesdropper to find the original location. And we propose a flexible routing strategy, called Multi-routing Random Walk, which protects the sensor's location. Our strategy can efficiently reduce the chance of packets being detected.},

abstract={The Internet-of-Things is a dynamic global network infrastructure where physical and virtual things communicate and share information amongst themselves. Plug-and-Interoperate is an approach that allows heterogeneous things to plug (into data) and seamlessly exchange information within the environment. To allow that, Plug-and-Interoperate needs to have the comprehension about the existing interoperability information. For this, the interoperability information needs to be duly organized. However, and in the Internet-of-Things, this presents major challenges. First, it is difficult to index all interoperability information due to the things heterogeneity (many and different languages and formats) and due to the dynamics of the system (disparate things entering/leaving the environment at all times). Also, that the environment can be used with much different purposes, which hinders the way on how the interoperability information should be organized. So, an architecture of an Interoperability Repository System is presented, in order to organize all interoperability information in this kind of environments. The solution handles heterogeneous interoperability information and allows users to add a User Space to the repository in order to customize it to specific needs. It also provides a notification mechanism in order to notify users of new or updated interoperability information.},

To realize the control of the building electrical equipments in the IOTBEE, controllers for such equipments are designed in this study. Provided with the switching control interface, the infrared control interface and the serial port control interface, the designed controller can be used to control many types of building electrical equipments such as the water dispensers and the air-conditioners in the IOTBEE. Additionally, the wireless network technology and the harmonic detection technology are adopted in the hardware and the software design of the controllers.

The associated management costs for information transmission and classification are becoming an almost unbearable burden due to the unprecedented number of data sources and the intrinsic vastness of the dataset. In this paper, we propose a novel lightweight approach capable of alleviating both aspects by leveraging on the advantages offered by classification methods to optimize communications and by enhancing information transmission to simplify data classification. In particular, we propose to adopt Motifs, recurrent features used for signal categorization, in order to compress data streams: in such a way it is possible to achieve compression levels of up to an order of magnitude, while maintaining the signal distortion rate within acceptable bounds and allowing for simple lightweight distributed classification and anomaly detection techniques. We elaborate about data representation and motif extraction methods for constrained devices, proposing a simple and effective solution for the problem. We validate our approach with an extensive simulation campaign thoroughly spanning the system parameter set. This work paves the road ahead for the realization of a universal signal processor for constrained devices in the Internet of Things, which will be capable of appropriately handling any given data while at the same time increasing communication efficiency.},

This paper proposed a three-layer QoS scheduling model for service-oriented IoT. At application layer, the QoS schedule scheme explores optimal QoS-aware services composition by using the knowledge of each component service. At network layer, the model aims at dealing with scheduling of heterogeneous networks environment; at sensing layer, it deals with the information acquisition and resource allocation scheduling for different services. The proposed QoS-aware scheduling for service-oriented IoT architecture is able to optimize the scheduling performance of IoT network and minimize the resource costs.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is a novel approach of connecting things/objects and thus transmitting information from the physical world to control centres (or vice versa) where this information can be interpreted. Where majority of the research focuses on sensor technologies (including energy harvesting), communications and routing, this paper positions itself on a higher layer, i.e., message scheduling, which is more targeted towards service provisioning. In particular messages are classified into high priority (HP) and best effort (BE) and the corresponding Quality of Service (QoS) scheduling algorithm is proposed. Doing so will enable the IoT network to differ emergency messages from non-mission critical messages. In addition, network-layer routing algorithms are also taken into consideration in message scheduling, aiming to provide a more optimal solution by applying certain degree of cross-layer design methodology. Here sensor nodes are divided in IoT subgroups. Each subgroup has a broker delivering for all nodes and maintaining two queues for HP and BE messages respectively. QoS awareness is introduced in IoT subgroups by assigning traffic priorities and scheduling them with proposed algorithm making them energy efficient as well. Simulation results have shown the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.},

Specifically, it is designed for inheriting all advantages of the fixed size packet MAC protocols for wireless sensor networks. Basically, the proposed scheme can be viewed as a proper extension of fixed-length frame scheme whether in wireline network or wireless network in IoT. The effectiveness of scheme is demonstrated by comparing the energy efficiency with the fixed-size frame for WSN and the variable-size frame for WLANs.

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) aims to connect everything at anywhere and anytime, in which objects need to be mapped from the physical world to the cyber world for further processing. Time and space characteristics are the basic features of objects in the physical world, and are significant for objects' physical-cyber world mapping. However, space-time data is usually formatted in different ways, and may not be precise enough in some cases due to the variety of technologies and systems. In this paper, we study the space-time registration for a single IoT application (i.e., Unit IoT) and multiple IoT applications (i.e., Ubiquitous IoT). Meanwhile, space-time consistency is discussed in U2IoT (i.e., Unit IoT, and Ubiquitous IoT). Moreover, a case study is discussed to present trajectory estimation in the airport scenario, and indicate the importance of space-time data when objects are mapped from the physical world to the cyber world by different methods for IoT ubiquitous connection.},

This paradigm like any man-made infrastructure is subject to disasters, outages and other adversarial conditions. Under these situations provisioned communications fail, rendering this paradigm with little or no use. Hence, network self-organization among these devices is needed to allow for communication resilience. This paper presents a survey of related work in the area of self-organization and discusses future research opportunities and challenges for self-organization in the Internet of Things. We begin this paper with a system perspective of the Internet of Things. We then identify and describe the key components of self-organization in the Internet of Things and discuss enabling technologies. Finally we discuss possible tailoring of prior work of other related applications to suit the needs of self-organization in the Internet of Things paradigm.},

However, the detection of tagged-objects is faced with the critical challenge of tag dynamics, which mainly arises from the movement of tagged physical objects. To capture tag dynamics, the application needs to detect the presence/absence of tags in an accurate, timely and cost-effective way. To address these challenges, we propose the Prediction of Tag Dynamics (PTD) algorithm. PTD achieves runtime detection of tagged-objects by i) streaming of the temporally-correlated tag readings obtained from persistent tracking of the tagged-object, and ii) runtime prediction of tag dynamics based on the streaming of tag readings. The performance of PTD is investigated based on real implementation and experimental evaluation, where PTD processes tag readings gathered with high fidelity from persistent tracking of real activities of tagged objects. The evaluation results demonstrate the accuracy, timeliness and cost-effectiveness of PTD.},

abstract={The incessant decrease in size, cost, and energy consumption of wireless devices is likely to boost the number of wireless devices dramatically. These will be deployed in several real world objects that we use in our daily life as envisioned by the Internet of Things (IoT) concept. Designing effective and efficient objects' location update and search mechanisms, is very important but is extremely difficult in the IoT scenarios. In fact, the number of mobile objects composing the IoT will be huge; this implies that signaling traffic generated for location update and discovery purposes can explode. Also, objects might currently be located where positioning solutions are not available or are not accurate enough to support most of the envisioned added value IoT applications. In this paper it is studied how object group mobility can be exploited to achieve accurate location update and search in the IoT, while reducing the signaling overhead. Object group mobility is a phenomenon that naturally emerges as usually moving objects are carried by a human or a vehicle together with several other objects. In this paper i) the concept of object group mobility is introduced and it is explained how and to which extent this can be used to reduce signaling overhead and improve accuracy in object location information; ii) the concept of collective-agent is introduced to further decrease signaling overhead in the IoT scenarios where object group mobility emerges, iii) an analytical framework is derived to assess the advantages of exploiting object group mobility in IoT scenarios.},

While various strategies have been developed to reduce power consumption of hardware components by transitioning them to lower power states or hibernating them when workload is relative low, they fail to work for latency-sensitive applications in virtualization environment. This paper presents a novel paravirtualized power-aware hypervisor as Cloud Computing infrastructure fits for latency-sensitive applications. This hypervisor introduces latency measurement process in guest OS side and CPU Power Modulator in host OS side. It enables the host OS modulate the CPU frequency level to save power with latency guarantee in guest OS side.

Therefore, we will in this paper study the limits when sharing contextual information from mobile devices, as well as finding the impact of this information overload for the Internet-of-Things. Furthermore, we present an evaluation model for assessing the effort required to present applications with relevant context information.

abstract={In the Internet of Things (IoT) a large number of devices enable data communication and interaction between physical objects and the cyber world. An important feature of IoT is the possibility of having mobile objects equipped with sensing devices. In service-enabled IoT platforms, where data and interacting are provisioned as services, access and utilisation of these services are affected by the mobility of the resources that provide the data and services. In a reliable and dependable environment, service continuity is supported in scenarios where the IoT resources are mobile or can become unavailable due to handover delays, network disconnection or power outage. In this paper, we propose a resource mobility scheme with two operating modes - caching and tunnelling. We use these methods to enable applications to access the sensory data when the resources become temporarily unavailable. We have implemented a prototype for the proposed scheme in a mobile scenario. The evaluation results show a reduction of service loss in mobility scenarios by 30%.},

In order to overcome the problem, it is very important to describe and match the heterogeneous device services with semantics. We use web service interface specification to wrap device, and OWL to describe services in semantic. In this paper we introduce a semantic device bus for Internet of things, which will allow service creation of different devices, management of device services, semantic description and matching of device services, and complex collaboration of device services.

Secondly, it introduces a Next-Best-Thing Triage (NBT) Model for use in conjunction with the 1-2-3 Zones approach where necessary and vice versa. These two `approaches' are essential for the DF process from an IoT perspective: the atypical nature of IoT sources of evidence (i.e. Objects of Forensic Interest - OOFI), the pervasiveness of the IoT environment and its other unique attributes - and the combination of these attributes - dictate the necessity for a systematic DF approach to incidents. The two approaches proposed are designed to serve as a beacon to incident responders, increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of their IoT-related investigations by maximizing the use of the available time and ensuring relevant evidence identification and acquisition. The approaches can also be applied in conjunction with existing, recognised DF models, methodologies and frameworks.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is envisaged as a unified network of `smaller' networks that live on the fringes of the Internet, such as systems that monitor and control buildings, industrial plants, the power grid, etc. The Internet Protocol (IP) has been promoted as the transport glue that implements this vision. Although we observe a converged view from the various application domains that their gateways should adopt IP, it is clear that the path to full adoption is long. The gateways may impose very specific requirements of security, resilience to failures, ease of maintenance and upgrade. We present the design goals of an enhanced architecture for the IoT that can reduce such concerns, paving the way for faster adoption of IP in the IoT. We argue that the functions one needs to perform in IoT networks of various application domains can be summarised in a small group of basic request-response operations, which traverse gateways and act as the transport layer. We describe how more complex functions, abstracted into server-based processes, can then be executed by the basic transport operations. With this approach we aim to reduce the technology-specific functions of IoT gateways, which now even become transparent, at best.},

Despite significant work on architectures and test facilities for the IoT, there is still a lack of management functionality to overcome the technological heterogeneity and complexity of the underlying networks and IoT infrastructure, so as to enhance context/situational-awareness, reliability, and energy-efficiency of IoT applications. This article presents a cognitive management framework for the IoT aiming to address these issues, comprising three levels of functionality: virtual objects (VOs), composite VOs (CVOs), and service levels. Cognitive entities at all levels provide the means for self-management (configuration, optimization, and healing) and learning. Three fundamental processes of this framework are presented: dynamic CVO creation, knowledge-based CVO instantiation, and CVO self-healing. A first prototype implementation of this framework and corresponding derived results are presented.},

The emerging pervasive healthcare enabled by the Internet-of-Things offers promising solutions. In addition, an in-home healthcare station (IHHS) is needed to meet the rapidly increasing demands for daily monitoring and on-site diagnosis and prognosis. In this paper, a pervasive and preventive medication management solution is proposed based on intelligent and interactive packaging (I2Pack) and intelligent medicine box (iMedBox). The intelligent pharmaceutical packaging is sealed by the Controlled Delamination Material (CDM) and controlled by wireless communication. Various vital parameters can also be collected by wearable biomedical sensors through the wireless link.

abstract={Approximately 25 researchers from Europe, Asia, and the US discussed applications and new challenges of linking networked objects reporting about their state, location, and conditions to mobile phones, networked appliances, and devices. Reports of several research projects yielded a consensus that simply building platforms and tools is not enough for doing successful research. Instead, research should target larger user bases and aim for larger-scale evaluations. Accordingly, discussions emerged about how to drive user adoption of research prototypes, when development transits from research to service provision, and a new notion of privacy where users who share their own data are be granted access to services that build on this data. The overall conclusion was that users no longer communicate only with people but also are empowered to interact with objects. The IoT was seen to reach a tipping point of not only embracing corporate users but also approaching the everyday user.},

We considered it as discrete energy minimization problem and mapped it into Hopfield neural network with the fuzzy c-means strategy to realize TDMA schedule for nodes in communication network. The fuzzy Hopfield neural network(FHNN) increases the convergence rate and decreases the processing time for broadcast scheduling problem. Simulation confirms that FHNN could be applied to the Internet of things which is covered everything all over the world. It could improve the visibility and control of the supply chain.},

A complex system has a large number of design variables and decision-making requires real-time data collected from machines, processes, and business environments. Enterprise systems (ESs) are used to support data acquisition, communication, and all decision-making activities. Therefore, information technology (IT) infrastructure for data acquisition and sharing affects the performance of an ES greatly. Our objective is to investigate the impact of emerging Internet of Things (IoT) on ESs in modern manufacturing. To achieve this objective, the evolution of manufacturing system paradigms is discussed to identify the requirements of decision support systems in dynamic and distributed environments; recent advances in IT are overviewed and associated with next-generation manufacturing paradigms; and the relation of IT infrastructure and ESs is explored to identify the technological gaps in adopting IoT as an IT infrastructure of ESs. The future research directions in this area are discussed.},

Based on the results of an explorative study of task management in a user's daily electronic life, and earlier work on information management in e-mail, we begin a restructuring of the domain of Internet e-mail. The purpose is to make it even more suitable for message-based communication in organizations where many users, groups, and tasks are involved. By introducing the concept of tasks we hypothesize that e-mail can be made more usable for managing short-term interests of a user. We describe a design of a multi-agent architecture that supports the integration of disparate and distributed information sources. Our goal is to combine the information in the sources for the dynamic and automatic construction of classification and prioritization rules. A prototype implementing the architecture is tentatively described, which uses information from the user's current electronic environment to manage her short-term interests.},

abstract={Widespread adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) applications assumes a sustainable ecosystem of firms creating, distributing, and using these applications. Such an ecosystem often forms around a platform that implements commonly used functionality and offers it to the members of the ecosystem for creating applications and services. In IoT, such a platform may be materialized in a form of a cloud platform that supports the management of connected devices, and the development and use of the applications based on them. A number of cloud platforms targeting IoT applications are available in the market; to prosper, they need to assist the providers of the IoT applications in designing and developing the applications, as well as in deploying and operating the application software. In this paper, a framework for evaluating the IoT platforms from the perspective of how widely they cover the potential needs of the application providers is introduced. Based on the framework, the maturity of the available IoT platforms is evaluated, by using the publicly available information about the platforms' features and supporting services. As the results of this initial analysis suggest, none of the platforms today offers the comprehensive support. This can be seen as a factor contributing to a slow adaption of the IoT platforms, and therefore to the slower-than-expected takeoff of the IoT ecosystem in general.},

abstract={To alleviate the air pollution problem caused by vehicle emissions, different vehicle inspection programs have been introduced, in which vehicles are examined by undergoing a number of emission tests. However, these emission tests are usually cost-ineffective and time-consuming. It is also difficult to enforce the vehicle owners on monitoring the health of their engines daily and taking immediate action to fix their vehicle emission problems. Therefore, this paper proposes a new vehicle emission inspection and notification system to help daily monitoring of engine health through the concept of Internet of Things. As there are numerous traffic lights in an urban area, they are employed to play an important role in the proposed system. By the fact that every car must stop in front of red lights, reliable reading of air ratio (‘é) from a vehicle, which indicates the engine emission status, can be interrogated wirelessly through mature and low-price radio frequency identification (RFID) technology. By inspecting the ‘é in real time, the vehicle emissions can be effectively controlled by the governmental authorities. Meanwhile, several implementation issues have also been considered and analyzed in this paper. An innovative method is proposed to select the appropriate traffic lights on which RFID monitoring devices should be installed.},

abstract={The potential of the artificial intelligence to build solutions based on the understanding of human behaviours, and the capacity to discover patterns through their interactions with the world is being extended with the capabilities of the Internet of Things. The described potential, so-called Human Dynamics, pursues to describe in real-time the human behaviours and activities. These goals are starting to be feasible through the quantity of data provided by two of the main areas of the Internet of Things, on the one hand, the Smart cities to make more intelligent the environment and offer a smart space that sense our movements, actions, and the evolution of the ecosystem, and on the other hand, the wearable and mobile computing which allows to provide data from the humans itself, i.e., from their pockets (smart phones), wrists (smart watches), hearts (wearable sensors), and eyes (glasses). This work analyses the ecosystem defined through the triangle formed by Big Data, Smart Cities and Wearable Computing to determinate human dynamics. For this purpose, the life-cycle of human dynamics determinations in Smart Cities have been analysed in order to determinate the current status of the technology, challenges, and opportunities.},

abstract={In this paper, the application of video-based information processing technology in the Internet of things has been researched. Currently, the real-time of most video-based identification methods is not satisfactory. The Hausdorff distance plays an important role in object recognition. However, when comparing the relationship between objects, the traditional Hausdorff distance even some modified Hausdorff distances need to traverse all the points of the image to be matched, which is a non-linear operator. In order to deal with the real-time problem, an improved Hausdorff distance algorithm based on central detection method is proposed. Due to narrowing the search range of space when calculating the Hausdorff distance, the computing speed has been improved compared with the traditional Hausdorff distance for object recognition. An example of vehicles recognition is used to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method. Experimental results show that compared with the LTS-HD, the new Hausdorff distance can not only guarantee the accuracy of matching but also enhance the perception between objects in real time.},

abstract={With the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm, potentially private data could be made available on the Internet. Such data could then, be consumed by a growing number of applications. The acceptance and success of new pervasive applications depend on both the protection of privacy and the guarantee of quality of context (QoC). As in the IoT producers and consumers of context are decoupled, they are not aware of each other. Therefore, it is essential to provide them with means to express their guarantees and requirements concerning QoC and privacy. For this purpose, we propose meta-models to design context contracts defining privacy and QoC agreements, independently of the consumer and the producer sides. The contracts are key to an autonomous management of QoC and privacy in the IoT. Firstly, contracts may be modified at runtime to add, edit or remove clauses. Secondly, the middleware in charge of transmitting data from context producers to context consumers (e.g., context managers) will be able to match QoC/privacy requirements and guarantees. Finally, the matching process can adapt dynamically, for instance, to the current trust level between the two parties. These contracts will participate to build trust among IoT participants.},

Hence, network self-organization among these devices is needed to allow for communication resilience. This paper presents a survey of related work in the area of self-organization and discusses future research opportunities and challenges for self-organization in the Internet of Things. We begin this paper with a system perspective of the Internet of Things. We then identify and describe the key components of self-organization in the Internet of Things and discuss enabling technologies. Finally we discuss possible tailoring of prior work of other related applications to suit the needs of self-organization in the Internet of Things paradigm.},

To solve this problem, we propose a General Statistical Database Cluster Mechanism for Big Data Analysis in the Internet of Things (IOT-StatisticDB) in this paper. In IOT-StatisticDB, statistical functions are performed through statistical operators inside the DBMS kernel, so that complicated statistical queries can be expressed in the standard SQL format. Besides, statistical analysis is executed in a distributed and parallel manner over multiple servers so that the performance can be greatly improved, which is confirmed by the experiments.},

abstract={Due to the high bandwidth requirements and stringent delay constraints of multi-user wireless video transmission applications, ensuring that all video senders have sufficient transmission opportunities to use before their delay deadlines expire is a longstanding research problem. We propose a novel solution that addresses this problem without assuming detailed packet-level knowledge, which is unavailable at resource allocation time (i.e. prior to the actual compression and transmission). Instead, we translate the transmission delay deadlines of each sender's video packets into a monotonically-decreasing weight distribution within the considered time horizon. Higher weights are assigned to the slots that have higher probability for deadline-abiding delivery. Given the sets of weights of the senders' video streams, we propose the low-complexity Delay-Aware Resource Allocation (DARA) approach to compute the optimal slot allocation policy that maximizes the deadline-abiding delivery of all senders. A unique characteristic of the DARA approach is that it yields a non-stationary slot allocation policy that depends on the allocation of previous slots. This is in contrast with all existing slot allocation policies such as round-robin or rate-adaptive round-robin policies, which are stationary because the allocation of the current slot does not depend on the allocation of previous slots. We prove that the DARA approach is optimal for weight distributions that are exponentially decreasing in time. We further implement our framework for real-time video streaming in wireless personal area networks that are gaining significant traction within the new Internet-of-Things (IoT) paradigm. For multiple surveillance videos encoded with H.264/AVC and streamed via the 6tisch framework that simulates the IoT-oriented IEEE 802.15.4e TSCH medium access control, our solution is shown to be the only one that ensures all video bitstreams are delivered with acceptable quality in a deadline-- biding manner.},

However, adoption of the research by industry has been largely methodological rather than based on precise specifications in architecture description languages (ADLs) or rigorously underpinned by formal models of behaviour and non-functional attributes. Why is this? Why were the actual formalisms and tools not more widely adopted? Can we draw any lessons from this? In this talk, I hope to explore this further, drawing on my personal experience as a researcher in distributed software architectures. I particularly hope to tickle the fancy of the younger members of our community, indicating the excitement of research, the benefits of belonging to a vibrant research community such as ours, and the benefits of being an active contributor. For the more mature researchers, there will be some nostalgic memories combined with some inevitable stepping on toes.

Adaptability and advanced services for ambient intelligence in the internet of things require an intelligent technological support for knowing the needs and the desires of users in the interactions with the environment for their daily use. To this purpose in some cases we can discover these characteristics by observing the human behavior, while in others we can retrieve stored information associated to the person. In both cases, the use of biometrics can be extremely useful both to understand the human behavior and to identify the person or the class of persons with similar characteristics so as to derive their needs and desires. Biometric technologies allow in fact for analyzing human traits (e.g., face, fingerprint, palm) for identity management without requiring individuals to carry tokens or remembering information. These technologies allow also for classifying the persons by observing some soft-biometric traits (e.g., gait, height, weight, emotions), thus associating the needs typical of the detected class. Besides, some other soft-biometric traits (e.g., gestures, gait) allow for specifying actions desired by the person. This talk will analyze the opportunities offered by biometric technologies and applications to support the realization of adaptable operations and intelligent services in the internet of things for ambient intelligence, based on a user-centric philosophy.

But, at the same time, it is a challenge task as there is an information transmission lag in the existing model of supply chain management. The need of supply chain visibility and transparency in pharmaceutical industry has increased tremendously with the emerging auto-identification technologies. The motivation to introduce auto-identification technologies could be to gain rapid benefits in visualization of supply chain information. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and EPC can be used to meet this attempt. With the advent of accurate and reliable information transmission, various supply chain concepts, such as adaptive logistics management, virtual warehouse, and counterfeit combat can be achieved. The main aim of this paper is to outline the possibility of applying RFID and Internet of Things in enhancing the pharmaceutical supply chain information transmission.

abstract={Internet of things (IoT) has provided a promising choice for structural health monitoring (SHM) recently. In vibration-based structural health monitoring, structural features which are extracted from periodically spaced measurement using sensors are subject to variable environmental conditions. This paper proposes an environmental effect removal based structural health monitoring scheme in an IoT environment. Principal component analysis (PCA) is employed to eliminate environment effects from sensor data which contain both real vibration feature of architectural structure and environmental interferences. After environmental effects removal, Hilbert-Huang transformation (HHT) which is a classical method for signal analysis is used for structural health analysis and monitoring. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves high accuracy in structural health monitoring and robust performance against environmental interferences.},

The realization is base on an implementation of mobile wireless sensors able to flow without any restraint in any kind of conduit. A dedicated design procedure allows the minimization of the sensing and transmitting hardware, maintaining a strong transmission efficiency even when pipelines are deployed underground. The wireless device is interfaced with an acoustic sensor suitable inside liquids and it is is waterproofed, so that its insertion within pipes filled of liquid has been made possible. The sensor communicates to fixed stations deployed on the ground. These stations collect the measured data and repeat them towards an Internet gateway, allowing remote post-processing of the information and the classification of the pipeline, in terms of possible leakages, obstructions, or sediments. The introduced technological solution has been experimentally validated in a controlled scenario, where an äóìad-hocäó wireless sensor network has been specifically designed and realized. Results show the exploitability and reliability of the proposed platform.},

The data flow in the EPCglobal network, which was created for äóìtraditionaläó low-cost tags, does work one-way: from tags to a couple of servers where data for the tags is stored and can be accessed by other readers or servers. To draw advantage from the increased functionality of the tags it will become important to have a two-way end-to-end communication between servers and tags, e.g. to remotely change data on the tags. In this paper we show how to modify RFID readers and low-cost tags to make them suitable for a remote two-way communication. We consider the required capabilities of readers and tags and show how communication can be done via mobile IPv6. Security considerations round the description before we can conclude, that also passive low-cost RFID tags are able to become part of the future Internet of Things.},

A compelling story about the elderly can make the adult children emotionally attached to their elderly parents and establish a healthy social connection between them. In this work, we propose a data-driven story generation system based on the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT based techniques enable the real time collection of the elderly's environment data through various sensors located in the home. The story generation system can weave the information mined from the sensor data into a story with high persuasive and emotion arousing power. Our system automatically collects raw sensor data on the cloud server and maps them to values of semantically meaningful context variables through activity functions. A director agent organizes the story plot with a Goal Net based approach and dynamically generates storylines based on a set of scene selection rules. The proposed system is carefully studied with a simulated smart home environment.},

abstract={The cheap and low-quality sensor devices are usually used for event detection in Internet of Things (IoT), and they put limitations on power, memories and computing capabilities. Those limitations need to be considered while designing our outlier detection algorithm. In this paper, we try to present an adaptive online outlier detection algorithm to handle data measurements for event detection. Namely, the proposed algorithm needs to provide the capability to tolerant those data which would be classified as outliers by traditional algorithms. With an accurate ratio of outliers and a tolerance parameter, a tolerance-based adaptive online outlier detection (TAOOD) algorithm is proposed. The contributions of TAOOD are two folds: (i) TAOOD decreases the amount of transmitted data by discarding duplicate data and outliers, (ii) TAOOD eliminates the limitation of original window-based outlier detection algorithm by adapting an accurate ratio of outliers and a tolerance parameter. Extensive simulations demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

abstract={The recent trend of ubiquitous computing and the Internet of Things demands everyday objects to be IP addressable and Internet accessible. This brings forward the challenges of converting or mapping formerly isolated wireless sensor networks (WSNs) to be IP compatible. IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN) is one of the first protocols which provide IP compatibility to low data rate WSNs. While 6LoWPAN is efficient for WSNs, there are other limitations such as different physical layers and radio interfaces which will break the information flow between heterogeneous IP-compatible networks and the Internet. In this paper, an integrated hardware/software solution is presented to bridge two heterogeneous 6LoWPAN networks. It is motivated by the necessity of merging a body area network and an environment control network in typical health monitoring applications of an intelligent environment. The unification is achieved through use of a physical serial bus, making a single hybrid router with the capability to route packets across both networks. The commonalities between two 6LoWPAN implementations allow highly efficient packet translation between two network stacks. Internet connectivity was added though use of an edge router, and allows each node to be addressed and accessed directly from anywhere on the Internet.},

Today and for the coming decades we see rising interest in interconnecting `Things' as we did in the past two decades when we interconnected PCs and servers to build the called Internet. Smart things interconnection is more general and complex due to different challenges: heterogeneity of devices, diversity of protocols, variety or none established standards, self-manageability, self-organization, dynamic architectures, mobility, intermittent availability, distributed computing, security and privacy. Awareness of these challenges is increasing but dedicated solutions are still at the starting-point. Current proposal is a model allowing smart things interconnection and interoperability. It is mainly based on `service' concept but can bind peer models like `object' concept and standard-based architectures. It is, also, a tentative to learn from biological entities and real environment. `Things' in the IoT are at the origin smart electronic devices with some communication capability. These devices, in our concept, are not considered as unique entity but fragmented into a set of services independently of their architecture, functionality and content. Services in IoT are much more than simple data/document exchange, they are expanded, but not limited, to real world actions, metrics and events.},

An anchor-free localization algorithm for large scale shopping carts was proposed. Specifically, by introducing the procedure of FastMap algorithm, a fast mapping from pairwise proximity matrix between shopping carts to corresponding coordinates was implemented. In this process, location area was divided into different square sub-regions and anchor nodes were placed on the vertex of square as pivot nodes. The output of FastMap algorithm was sent to initialize MDS in order to make stress converge to global minimum quickly. Simulation experiments with 3600 virtual nodes in 600mí„600m location area and 10 real shopping carts tests in a supermarket were carried out. All the results show that our algorithm reduces the complexity comparing with classic MDS and random MDS algorithm, also meets the demand of application in supermarket.},

Massive and various devices have generated large kinds of applications, however they also bring new challenges for the network maintenance and management. One of the significant differences between Internet and Internet of things is that, the embedded devices are a major category of devices in the IoT, which are with single function, poor performance and in huge quantities. When divided by their functions, they are all monitoring devices that are distributed in the network and collecting data all the time. Large amount of data that are generated in real time should be transmitted to the collecting and computing devices the fast the better. How to transmit the data efficiently and how to meet the needs of variety of different applications are the new challenges arisen. In this paper, the data transmission characteristics and different applications' requirements in the IoT are detailed analyzed. Further more, a new data processing model, which is a message oriented middleware data processing model, is proposed.

abstract={Summary form only given. As we continue scaling towards 14 nm and beyond, reliability is becoming an integral part of the complete technology offering. Building in reliability is critical to the success of future scaling. As we marched towards the sub 100 nm technologies material changes have been necessary to meet the power, performance and reliability requirements. In sub 45 nm regime SiOx based dielectrics have been replaced by HK MG leading to new degradation mechanisms such as PBTI and also changed the understanding of existing mechanisms such as TDDB. Similar challenges exist for backend and middle-of-line reliability where scaling presents challenges for RC delay as well as metal and dielectric reliability. Process solutions for improved electromigration reliability like alloy seed enhancement and metal capping degrade the resistance of interconnect and impact the dielectric reliability. Double patterning approaches also bring with them additional impacts to dielectric spacing and metal reliability. As we move beyond 20 nm new architecture and materials such as FINFETs and IIIäóñV channels will appear. It is critical to leverage our learning from past and develop understanding and solutions for the upcoming challenges.},

Thus, the integrity of data and trust in the services offering the data is crucial. Further, to protect important data and user interests, confidentiality of data and privacy of users must be ensured. Moreover, each request and response in the frame of IoT has to be authenticated in a proper and secure way to ensure accountability and proper operation. Finally, with the usage of IoT for vital functionalities, availability becomes increasingly important, although availability is out of the scope of this document. The resolution infrastructure introduced in this work is a crucial component of the overall IoT architecture and most security goals are anchored here. Our suggested architecture ensures privacy and security for the resolution functions and offers as well a basis for other security functionalities needed outside the resolution infrastructure.},

abstract={The concept of Internet of Things involves huge number of constrained devices such as wireless sensors to communicate in a machine-to-machine pattern. Based on the implementation scenario, such communication might take place over a public network such as the Internet, which is based on the TCP/IP stack. However, different research working groups argue that some of these stack protocols such as the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) might not be suitable for constrained devices. Therefore, the IETF Constrained RESTful Environments (CoRE) WG has proposed the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP); an application layer protocol for constrained devices in the IoTs. The CoRE WG proposed using IPSec or DTLS to secure the CoAP communication at different levels of the protocol stack. However, to investigate the feasibility of such a proposal, we use the X.805 security standard to analyze the security aspects of such implementation. The analysis highlights the main security drawbacks and hence argues of the need for a new integrated security solution.},

RA-AODVjr protocol is designed combining with the RA-Cluster and AODVjr routing protocol. This protocol selects the best neighbor in the terminal node and balances the network traffic when terminal node resource is constrained, using the relevance of the Ad hoc network. The simulation results show that the agreement achieves load balancing of energy constrained nodes to a certain extent. Compared with the original AODVjr protocol, due to the best neighbor node delivery technology, the local network traffic gets a better balance and less time delay means better choice of routing.},

Specifically, we consider a generic IoT scenario where a multimedia server provides heterogeneous applications without knowing the application's quality of experience (QoE) model and playout period. Our objective aims at dynamically adjusting the power allocation for each application over a uncertain period to maximize the system overall mean opinion score (MOS). Note that the practical QoE model can be observed over time, but the underlying functional relationship between the power and MOS is unknown. The highlight of this paper is to develop a dynamic powering algorithm, in which one learns the satisfaction function and optimizes power-aware user satisfaction with on-line operation. More precisely, the proposed algorithm performance is measured in terms of loss which denotes the MOS loss compared to the optimal one. Numerical simulation results validate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.},

But the access to the real-time real-world entities information of IOT is a prerequisite for all these work. To meet the demand of collecting real-time changing information for real-world entities, we present two real-time information collecting methods for IOT.

This promises a a wealth of opportunity for a large collection of distributed applications and services. However, the IoT introduces significant changes to the Internet model, largely in the form of billions to trillions of embedded devices that most likely will not be able to be managed centrally by cloud services due to lack of scalability. We suggest that the natural direction for IoT devices is to manage themselves, both in terms of their software/hardware configuration and their resource utilization. In this work, we describe the underlying framework for self-managing devices, comprising measurement-based learning and adaptation to changing system context and application demands. In addition, we describe several upcoming research challenges in order to realize this self-management vision.},

In this paper we present a framework that allows us to combine secure storage and secure communication in the IP-based IoT. We show how data can be stored securely such that it can be delivered securely upon request without further cryptographic processing. Our prototype implementation shows that combined secure storage and communication can reduce the security-related processing on nodes by up to 71% and energy consumption by up to 32.1%.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) application market (IAM) is supposed to be an effective approach for service distribution in the era of IoT. To protect the privacy and security of users, a systematic mechanism to determine the trustworthiness of the applications in the IAM is demanded. In this paper, an interactive trust model (ITM) is proposed based on interaction between application market and end users. In this model, application trustworthiness (AT) is quantitatively evaluated by the similarity between the application's behavior and the behavior expected by the user. In particular, by using the evaluation vector and feedback vector feature of application in the marketplace and behavior of applications on end devices can be exchanged in mathematical form to establish the connection between market and users. Behavior-based detecting agent on a users' device gives strong evidence about what applications have done to your privacy and security issues. Indicators derived by this model are presented in the market along with the application, and it helps users to more efficiently select the most appropriate application from the market.},

It will contribute to assert the concept of Internet of Things, where end-to-end security represents a key issue. In such context, it is very important to understand which protocols are able to provide the right level of security without burdening the limited resources of constrained networks. This paper presents a performance comparison between two of the most widely used security protocols: IPSec and DTLS. We provide the analysis of their impact on the resources of embedded devices. For this purpose, we have modified existing implementations of both protocols to make them properly run on our hardware platforms, and we have performed an extensive experimental evaluation study. The achieved results are not a consequence of a classical simulation campaign, but they have been obtained in a real scenario that uses software and hardware typical of the current technological developments. Therefore, they can help network designers to identify the most appropriate secure mechanism for end-to-end IP communications involving constrained devices.},

Besides, existing algorithms fail to provide efficient localization supports. In order to address this issue, we design an efficient localization algorithm using sparse anchors, LASA, by modeling IoT into mass-spring system. Compared with previous algorithms, LASA has a lower computational complexity. Theoretical analysis shows that the algorithm has a good feature of convergence and the computational complexity by O(N), where N is the maximum number of nodes' neighbors in IoT. We evaluate the performance of this algorithm through some simulations. The results show that LASA is robust to anchors' position and better for convergence.},

The IoT describes a vision where heterogeneous objects like computers, sensors, Radio-Frequency IDentification (RFID) tags or mobile phones are able to communicate and cooperate efficiently to achieve common goals thanks to a common IP addressing scheme. This paper focuses on the reliability of emergency applications under IoT technology. These applications' success is contingent upon the delivery of high-priority events from many scattered objects to one or more objects without packet loss. Thus, the network has to be self-adaptive and resilient to errors by providing efficient mechanisms for information distribution especially in the multi-hop scenario. As future perspective, we propose a lightweight and energy-efficient joint mechanism, called AJIA (Adaptive Joint protocol based on Implicit ACK), for packet loss recovery and route quality evaluation in the IoT. In this protocol, we use the overhearing feature, characterizing the wireless channels, as an implicit ACK mechanism. In addition, the protocol allows for an adaptive selection of the routing path based on the link quality. .},

This mandates research in how to safeguard interactions via heterogeneous means of communication involving interconnected local and non-local artifacts. In response to these challenges, this paper presents key schemes to secure interaction via heterogeneous means of communication. In conclusion, the architecture can securely authenticate an intelligent artifact as well as securely exchange sensor information with other authenticated artifacts attached in an overlay.

Processing these data stream generated by the IoT networks with different patterns has raised new challenges for the real-time performance of intrusion detection system (IDS) in IoT environments, which has to react quickly to the hacking attacks and malicious activities to IoT. In recent years, Complex Event Processing (CEP) technology provides new solutions in the field of complex pattern identifications and real-time data processing, which can be used to improve the performance of traditional IDS in IoT environments. IDS integrated with CEP can be used to deal with patterns among events and process large volumes of messages with low latency.

In order to avoid monopolistic control on IoT name service which is caused by a single root node, some researches have been done to create a federated name service. Yet a simple union of all existing name services cannot guarantee the equality of all participants. Based on the Identity Based Encryption (IBE) technology, we design an equitable federated name service for the IoT. First, Node Mapping Table (NMT) is distributed to each root nodes, which can effectively overcome the shortcomings of the centralized management. Second, the notification of creating or updating NMT will be digitally signed by multiple authorities together to ensure the real equity and fairness of the NMT.},

abstract={In the era of the Internet of Things (IOT), the information world and the entity world are gradually integrated. Thus, the ways that people obtain, transmit, store, update and analyze information are also undergoing profound change. These changes will undoubtedly bring some new challenges to the traditional Spatial Data Warehouse (SDW) system. Based on the analysis of the technical characteristics of IOT and its potential application trends which combine IOT technology with geographic information, firstly, we proposed an architecture solution for the Spatial Data Warehouse system in IOT environments (SDWIT). Secondly, the SDWIT system was constructed which supported by the architecture solution. In this paper, the data source layer, the data processing layer, the data storage layer and the application analysis layer of the SDWIT system are designed in detail. Together, the four layers achieve the collection, transmission, storage and update for the real-time or near real-time information of perceived entities. Thus, the SDWIT system realizes data integration and data fusion for the Abstract Data Type Data (ADTD) and Entity Perception Data (EPD), and improves the ability of data analysis and data mining. At the same time, it also ensures the interchange and process between person and person, person and things, things and things, and utilizes the integration advantage to compensate for some deficiencies of the traditional SDW system. Finally, in the view of technology integration application of IOT technology fusing with GPS, Virtual Reality and Mobile GIS, a next generation innovation application mode of IOT under the support of the SDWIT system was briefly discussed.},

abstract={To date implementations of Internet of Things (IoT) architectures are confined to particular application areas and tailored to meet only the limited requirements of their narrow applications. To overcome technology and sector boundaries this paper proposes a dynamic service creation environment that employs i) orchestration of business services based on re-usable IoT service components, ii) self-management capable components for automated configuration and testing of services for things, and iii) abstraction of the heterogeneity of underlying technologies to ensure interoperability. To ensure reliability and robustness the presented approach integrates self-testing and self-adaptation in all service life cycle phases. The service life cycle management distinguishes the IoT service creation phase (design-time) and the IoT service provision phase (run-time). For test-friendly service creation (1) semantic service descriptions are employed to derive semi-automatically services and related tests, (2) and testing is systematically integrated into a Service Creation Environment. For reliable and robust service provisioning the presented system (3) forces validation tests in a sandbox environment before deployment and (4) enables run-time monitoring for service adaptation. The system under test is modelled by finite state machines (FSM) that are semi-automatically composed of re-usable test components. Then path searching algorithms are applied to derive automatically tests from the FSM model. The resulting tests are specified in the test control notation TTCN-3 and compiled to run the validation tests.},

abstract={Digital sensing, processing, and communication capabilities will be ubiquitously embedded into everyday objects, turning them into an Internet-of-things (IoT, also known as, machine-to-machine, M2M). More importantly, everyday objects will become data generators, with sensors everywhere continuously collecting a large quantity of data about their context and use, processors everywhere analyzing and inferring useful knowledge from the data, and finally communication radios transmitting and exchanging useful knowledge with other objects and to äóìcloudäó based resources. This is the next-generation Internet - rather than data mainly produced by humans and for humans, in the new machine-to-machine-era Internet, data are generated by machines (sensors), communicated without human involvement to other machines (servers or other computer systems) for automated processing to enable automated or human actions, driving speeds and scales unseen by the existing Internet. Distributed video cameras will play important roles in various IoT/M2M applications. To resolve the problems of high data rate, high power consumption, and large deployment cost of large-scale distributed video sensors, perpetual video cameras, where net energy consumption is almost zero, are required. Many technologies and design challenges are introduced for designing such cameras, such as energy harvesting, distributed video coding, distributed video analysis, and the associated VLSI designs. To bring up these issues and challenges, in this tutorial, we will provide (1) an overview of challenges/opportunities in M2M, (2) an introduction of distributed smart cameras in M2M applications, (3) the analysis of power consumption of distributed cameras, (4) an introduction of energy harvesting techniques, (5) distributed video coding and (6) distributed video analysis techniques, where both the state-of-the-art works and possible future research directions will be shown.

abstract={The rapid increase in vehicle fleet size and consequently in traffic volume is not always followed by an increase in road space. As a result, traffic congestion occurs, especially in large urban areas. Therefore, in order to avoid traffic jams, immediate solutions have to be found. Various technologies have been used to design and develop such solutions in the past. While some developers have used classic technologies, others have integrated various emerging technologies in the systems they built in order to make roadways safer. Acting both inside the vehicle and along the roadways the new designed systems are able to inform drivers about traffic conditions and possible hazards. This paper proposes an Internet of Things-based approach to solve some of the problems that traffic congestion raises. Furthermore, this approach provides the means to monitor a set of environmental parameters, including air quality, and to raise early warnings and alarms when critical levels are reached. This approach offers a solution to increasing traffic-related pollution (which has a negative impact on the environment and on people's health), to economic losses and to other issues caused by traffic congestions. In order to reduce accident risks when various intervention vehicles enter the cross-roads, we also propose a solution based on radio frequency identification (RFID) technology.},

This gap will continue to grow, as more objects gain the ability to directly interface with the Internet or become physical representations of data accessible via Internet systems. This trend toward greater independent object interaction in the Internet is collectively described as the Internet of Things (IoT). As with previous global technology trends, such as widespread mobile adoption and datacentre consolidation, the changing operating environment associated with the Internet of Things represents considerable impact to the attack surface and threat environment of the Internet and Internet-connected systems. The increase in Internet-connected systems and the accompanying, non-linear increase in Internet attack surface can be represented by several tiers of increased surface complexity. Users, or groups of users, are linked to a non-linear number of connected entities, which in turn are linked to a non-linear number of indirectly connected, trackable entities. At each tier of this model, the increasing population, complexity, heterogeneity, interoperability, mobility, and distribution of entities represents an expanding attack surface, measurable by additional channels, methods, and data items. Further, this expansion will necessarily increase the field of security stakeholders and introduce new manageability challenges. This document provides a framework for measurement and analysis of the security implications inherent in an Internet that is dominated by non-user endpoints, content in the form of objects, and content that is generated by objects without direct user involvement.},

Complex Event Processing (CEP) is the key part of IoT middleware which can help the user to get semantic meanings of primitive events. Context-awareness is an important feature of CEP engine. In this paper a high performance context-aware CEP architecture and method is proposed for internet of things. Context is modeled as fuzzy ontology to support uncertainty and linguistic variables in event queries. Based on fuzzy ontology query and reasoning, complex event query plans are generated and context-aware queries are rewritten into context independent sub-queries. Data window is partitioned according to different event patterns and context. The sub-queries are optimized and executed parallel based on data partition. The fundamental experiments show that this method can support fuzzy context in CEP and have acceptable performance and scalability.},

Disruptive Microelectronics which includes embedded systems, Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC), Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA), and Programmable Systems On a Chip (PSOC), is one of excellent case studies of disruptive technologies (or disruptive innovation) which is defined as an innovation that helps create a new market and value network, and eventually goes on to disrupt an existing market and value network (over a few years or decades), displacing an earlier technology. The Internet of Things is the next generation of the Internet connecting objects, not just people. Since the ultimate goal is to produce new industries globally, understanding, measuring, evaluating, and preserving the integrity of global engineering becomes fundamental. The latter is proposed to be addressed by Quality Assessment (QA) of emerging global engineering curricula and scholars involved in teaching of global engineering. For example, International Society for Engineering Education (IGIP) is one of the leaders providing international certification of scholars and one of the frontrunners in fostering engineering on line, critical for global engineering. The overall process of global engineering edu- ation addressing essential skills for engineers from any country to be competitive in an international market for engineering knowhow, with skills not longer limited to cultural sensitivity needed only for product design destined for diverse markets can be superbly captured by Service Science [Spohrer, 2008]. Service science is an interdisciplinary paradigm to the study, design, and implementation of complex systems in which specific arrangements of people and technologies take actions that provide value for others [3]. It is also a proposed academic discipline and research area that would complement multiplicity of disciplines that contribute to knowledge about service.},

In order to solve this serious problem, many countries and regions have already presented a series of emissions standards, meanwhile some methods has been developed, include update motor engine or improve the quality of the gasoline. However, these actions have not brought about a striking effect as we expect. There are also some situations to fail implement these emissions standards. In this paper, a wireless inspection and notification system (WINS) through the concept of Internet of Things (IoT) is proposed. By applying the system, it is possible to smoothly realize a green traffic network. In this system, Radio frequency identification (RFID) technology as a low-cost and mature wireless communication method is adopted to collect and transmit emissions information of vehicles. Moreover, The RFID devices need to be installed on the traffic lights so that reliable reading of emissions signals from a vehicle can be interrogated when the vehicles stop in front of the red light. Taken into consideration the real environment, an efficient and innovative maximum spanning tree algorithm (MXAST) is also presented to select suitable traffic lights aim to reduce the number of RFID devices (more economy) and guaranteed the whole urban cars can be monitored (simple & safety).},

abstract={The mining industry is seeing a bright future with a high demand for minerals and relatively high material prices. Much of this is driven by the rapid industrial expansion in countries such as China and others. However, even though the mining business seems promising, there are some important issues that must be addressed in order to maintain a cost-effective and competitive edge. Worker and environment safety, working conditions, are very important issues. Another issue is attracting skilled personal to work in the deep mines of the future. Today, the mining industry has problems hiring personnel, due to hazardous working environments and re-locating to the distant regions. If the workers' safety could be increased, attracting skilled personnel would become one less problem. Rock bolts and shotcrete are in use today to reinforce tunnel walls, and expensive measurement devices are used in order to monitor seismic activity and rock stress. However, by not having real-time monitoring of rock bolts makes it difficult to monitor them. A better approach would be to make rock bolts intelligent and have them measure stress and seismic activity. Furthermore, by connecting the rock bolts to a network, real-time monitoring of them is made feasible. In this paper, we propose the merger of the Internet of Things (IoT) approach with traditional rock bolts, thereby allowing online monitoring of rock bolt status. This enables an increased possibility to enhance work safety by being able to detect anomalies on the rock earlier, thereby giving workers and machinery an earlier alarm to evacuate hazardous locations in the mine.},

A key challenge of IOT is to assure high reliability software in a scalable and dynamic computing environment for data dissemination and task cooperation among sensor nodes. To effectively manage such data delivery and sensor cooperation, sensor networks may need data dissemination and cooperation protocol, such as the Sensor Data Transmission and Cooperation Service (SDTCS), which makes it easy to deal with complicated data delivery and sensor cooperation. To support higher reliability, sensor software is often required to provide updating service pack during mission execution owing to dynamic context environment. Therefore, Dynamic Software Updates (DSU) can be effectively applied for the IOT applications. This paper presents dynamic updating approach for SDTCS IOT applications. The proposed approach consists of the following:(1)one-sink-to-one-sensor;(2)one-sink-to-k-coverage-sensor;(3) multiple-sink-to-all-coverage-sensor. Performance analysis results for the suggestion protocol with different numbers of sensor nodes, different strategies are selected, which support high reliability and seamless service for SDTCS IOT applications.},

An important issue is to reduce the energy consumption in the sensor networks since sensor nodes always have energy constraints. Deployment of thousands of wireless sensors in an appropriate pattern will simultaneously satisfy the application requirements and reduce the sensor network energy consumption. This article deployed a number of sensor nodes to record temperature data. The data was then used to predict the temperatures of some of the sensor node using linear programming. The predictions were able to reduce the node sampling rate and to optimize the node deployment to reduce the sensor energy consumption. This method can compensate for the temporarily disabled nodes. The main objective is to design the objective function and determine the constraint condition for the linear programming. The result based on real experiments shows that this method successfully predicts the values of unknown sensor nodes and optimizes the node deployment. The sensor network energy consumption is also reduced by the optimized node deployment.},

Context awareness is used to align attributes and to intensify couplings between different decentralized resources by decomposing and aggregating internal ontology models. Knowledge, services and context make large-scale industrial networks more cognitive and feasible. Through the optimal composition of elementary services, decentralized applications are implemented in the service-oriented architecture.

A cost-efficient approach to examine large-scale networks is to use simulators or emulators to test the infrastructure and its ability to support the desired applications. In this paper, we investigate and compare the currently available simulation/emulation software. We found out that the current solutions are mostly appropriate for small- and medium-scale emulation, however they are not suitable for large-scale testing that reaches millions of node running concurrently. We then propose a large-scale IoT emulator called MAMMotH and present a brief overview of its design.

Focusing on the work of analyzing data, we propose PCA algorithm based technology in this paper, and apply it into works in the Internet of things. Through the theory and experimental results, we can prove that the technology we propose can select main information from prolix data, and complete the recognition works.},

Traditional IOT appliances are controlled through wireline facilities. Besides the high installation cost and poor scalability of the system, it is difficult for men to break away from shackles of various lines. Nevertheless, IOT appliances based on self-organizing WSNs can not only cast off lines and lower the cost, but also improve the scalability of the system a lot. Therefore it is essential to study IOT appliances on account of WSNs in smart homes. The paper discusses the wireless module selection in the self-organizing WSNs nodes, the design of multiAgent in the nodes and the overall structure of WSNs. The importance of norms in the development of IOT appliances is also mentioned in the paper.},

abstract={Advances in information and communication technologies have led to the emergence of Internet of Things (IoT). In the healthcare environment, the use of IoT technologies brings convenience to physicians and patients as they can be applied to various medical areas (such as constant real-time monitoring, patient information management, medical emergency management, blood information management, and health management). The radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology is one of the core technologies of IoT deployments in the healthcare environment. To satisfy the various security requirements of RFID technology in IoT, many RFID authentication schemes have been proposed in the past decade. Recently, elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)-based RFID authentication schemes have attracted a lot of attention and have been used in the healthcare environment. In this paper, we discuss the security requirements of RFID authentication schemes, and in particular, we present a review of ECC-based RFID authentication schemes in terms of performance and security. Although most of them cannot satisfy all security requirements and have satisfactory performance, we found that there are three recently proposed ECC-based authentication schemes suitable for the healthcare environment in terms of their performance and security.},

abstract={The recent forecast of billions of devices, all connected to the Internet and generating low-rate monitoring, measurement, or automation data that many end-users/applications frequently request, signifies the need for applying in-network caching techniques to Internet-of-Things (IoT) traffic. Although time delay is not critically important for small-sized IoT content, the expected total traffic load on the Internet from a large number of devices is significant. However, the main challenge as opposed to the typically cached content at content routers, e.g. multimedia files, is that IoT data are transient and therefore require different caching policies. This paper studies in-network caching of IoT data at content routers in the Internet. An IoT data item is uniquely defined not only by its time and location tags, but also a time-range value set by end-users/applications. We provide a model for the trade-off between multihop communication costs and the freshness of a transient data item. Results show that the model can successfully capture the effect of data transiency and can accurately represent the expected gains of a caching system: considerable savings in terms of reduction of network load, especially for highly requested data items.},

MAC protocols for wireless sensor networks based on CSMA/CA induce high overhead due to RTS/CTS packets and does not completely eliminate hidden terminal problems. A new technique, called Grid based Channel allocation and Access scheduling using Latin Squares (GAALS) can be effectively used for Channel allocation and Channel access. GAALS effectively increases the throughput and reduces end to end delay as well as jitter. Time division Multiple Access (TDMA) is used for both Channel allocation and Channel access in GAALS. In this paper, GAALS is modified to GALS, where grid based channel allocation using Latin Squares is done; but alternate techniques like Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) and Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) are considered for channel access and they are compared. Performance metrics which are used for comparison include throughput and delay. Simulation result shows that CDMA is a better channel access technique as compared to all the other techniques for channel access.},

They will also exchange data and information and locate themselves and other things that surround them. To interact, the things must recognize that they're in proximity of other things. It's anticipated that a widespread component of the IoT will be passive RFID tags, because they're inexpensive and provide automatic identification. However, passive RFID tags can't perform complex operations, such as proximity detection and localization. In this article, the authors describe existing problems with current RFID systems and survey potential solutions for proximity detection. They then present a new RFID device, called ""Sense-a-Tag"" (ST), that can passively detect and decode backscatter signals from tags in its proximity. The authors show that when STs are added to a standard RFID system, the problems of proximity detection in the IoT with RFID tags can readily be resolved. They demonstrate the feasibility of an ST-based RFID system through proximity detection experiments.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) revolution has major impacts on the network & Information Technology (IT) infrastructure. As IT in the past decade, network virtualization is simultaneously on its way with for instance Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) and Software-Defined Networking (SDN). NFV and SDN are approaches enhancing the infrastructure agility thus facilitating the design, delivery and operation of network services in a dynamic and scalable manner. IoT will push the infrastructure to its limit with numerous and diverse requirements to fulfill, we therefore believe that the agility brought by the combination of NFV and SDN is essential to face the IoT revolution. In this article, we first highlight some IoT challenges that the network & IT infrastructure will face. The NFV and SDN benefits are presented from a network operator point of view. Following a description of the IoT ecosystem and a recall of some of the IoT stakeholders expectations, a new multi-layered IoT architecture involving SDN and NFV and based upon network & IT resources is put forward. Finally, the article illustrates how the proposed architecture is able to cope with the identified IoT challenges.},

In order to well maintain those sensor devices, it is often necessary to evolve devices to function correctly by allowing device management entities to remotely monitor and control devices without consuming significant resources. In this paper, we propose a lightweight RESTful web service approach to enable device management of wireless sensor devices. Specifically, motivated by the recent development of IPv6 based open standards for accessing wireless resource constrained networks, we consider to implement 6LoWPAN/RPL/CoAP protocols on sensor devices and propose a CoAP based device management solution to allow easy access and management of IPv6 sensor devices. By developing a prototype cloud system, we successfully demonstrate the proposed solution in efficient and effective management of wireless sensor devices.},

In this context, a couple of standards have been already set, e.g., IPv6, 6LoWPAN (IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks), and M2M (Machine to Machine communications). In this paper, we focus on the integration of wireless sensor networks into IoT, and shed further light on the subtleties of such integration.

As a particular case of distributed systems, the Internet of Things (IoT) poses a set of renewed challenges, because of its scale, heterogeneity and properties traditionally associated with wireless sensor networks (WSN), shared sensing, continous processing and real time computing. To handle IoT features, we present a formalization of the task mapping problem that captures the varying consumption of resources and various constraints (location, capabilities, QoS) in order to compute a mapping that guarantees the lifetime of the concurrent tasks inside the network and the fair allocation of tasks among the nodes. It results in a binary programming problem for which we provide an efficient heuristic that allows its resolution in polynomial time. Our experiments show that our heuristic: (i) gives solutions that are close to optimal and (ii) can be implemented on reasonably powerful Things and performed directly within the network, without requiring any centralized infrastructure.},

Despite its high degree of applicability, the IoT faces some challenges. One of the most challenging problems is its dependability (reliability and availability), since a device failure might put people in danger or result in financial loss. An alternative to mitigate these consequences is the adoption of a strategy based on spare devices. If a primary device fails, the spare device could assume its functions in a safe way. Thus, this work proposes mathematical models based on Markov Chain which is able to estimate the reliability and availability of IoT applications considering redundancy aspects. The proposal can be used in order to provide valuable data at the early planning and design phases of an IoT application.},

The system is designed based on principles of Internet of Things to detect and identify the road irregularities in real-time. Road irregularity is a broad term which includes any potholes, cracks or random deviations that exist. Existing method measuring the irregularity is by visual interpretation. The system consists of accelerometers or tilts switches to measure the irregularity and also provides a real time data collection via a two way wireless communication and reuse of the same. It also has a global positioning system interface to monitor the coordinates of the irregularity and map the index of irregularity on a digital map via a cloud based service. The cloud service performs transformations on the data received simultaneously by all the devices on the ground. The resulting information about any forthcoming irregularities/obstacles is then disseminated to the consumers through existing mapping applications. Thus providing a feedback for the user to know the condition of the road and plan the safety measures or change the route direction all in real-time. The System adds great value to the existing mapping technology but making it more location aware. While the estimated results are approximate but the study provides a transfer function relating the inertia of the vehicle to that of the road profile. The study also provides the scope to maintain and analyze the road the conditions by the local administrative body.},

abstract={With the evolution of the Internet and related technologies, there has been an evolution of new paradigm, which is the Internet of Things, IoT. In the IoT, a large number of objects/devices on the Internet are connected to one another for information sharing, irrespective of their locations. These devices may be interconnected with one another using various network protocols and standards to exchange information between them. The underlying network used for information exchange generally has built-in intelligence, which is called ambient intelligence, so that it can make adaptive decisions for information exchange between these objects in theh IoT. This article provides a performance evaluation of the Bayesian coalition game among these objects in the IoT environment by using the concepts of game theory and LA. In comparison to the existing solutions, LA are assumed to be the players in the game having variable learning rates in the coalition game. Most of the existing solutions have considered constant learning rates of the players in the game, which may lead to the possibility of local optima at some points. Each player decides its actions using competitive learning, having variable learning rates, based on the newly defined utility function, which leads to the achievment of a Nash equilibrium in the game quickly. Each player receives feedback from the environment corresponding to the actions taken in a unit interval of time. The performance of the proposed scheme was evaluated with respect to various performance evaluation metrics. The results obtained show that the proposed scheme is useful in the IoT environment.},

abstract={Nowadays, the Internet of Things is able to provide more advanced services to people, which connects a variety of devices, systems and applications. However, it covers a variety of devices, protocols and applications, which makes it much more complex. In the main application areas, wireless sensor networks with a frequent but short communication character, it requires an efficient and flexible protocol to protect the information. To protect the traffic of the Internet of Things is the focal point of this research work. Although many protocols for the Internet have been put forward, it is still not enough to meet the increasingly complex requirements from applications. Many of them are not efficient enough to adapt the device diversity and timely communication environment. This paper is trying to address this problem, by proposing a peer-to-peer security protocol to satisfy this varied environment. Secure communication is implemented on an open sourced platform for the Internet of Things. Its less handshake in future sessions and dynamic security level adjustment feature satisfies the realistic demand on this platform. Finally, with a comparison test, the result shows that the proposed protocol is efficient to meet the specific goals and applicable for the Internet of Things applications.},

Location-based service is one of the vital applications in commercial, economic, and public domains. In this paper, we propose a novel localization scheme called NextMe, which is based on cellular phone traces. We find that the mobile call patterns are strongly correlated with the co-locate patterns. We extract such correlation as social interplay from cellular calls, and use it for location prediction from temporal and spatial perspectives. NextMe consists of data preprocessing, call pattern recognition, and a hybrid predictor. To design the call pattern recognition module, we introduce the notions of critical calls and corresponding patterns. In addition, NextMe does not require that the cell tower addresses should be bounded with concrete coordinates, e.g., global positioning system (GPS) coordinates. We validate NextMe across MIT Reality Mining Dataset, involving 500 000 h of continuous behavior information and 112 508 cellular calls. Experimental results show that NextMe achieves fine-grained prediction accuracy at cell tower level in the forthcoming 1-6 h with 12% accuracy enhancement averagely from cellular calls.},

Therefore, when a device has a problem with an interface, it can send a probe request to other devices using an alternative interface. We use collaborative mechanisms to diagnose the root cause of a network problem. It can use cooperation from internal nodes or send requests to external nodes. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by implementing an Android application and an algorithm that diagnoses a push notification failure.},

Some years ago, hearing things like smartphones, Internet and sensors would have sounded strange, but these are currently trending. Due to this steady trend, it is expedient to explore the numerous possibilities that may evolve. This paper provides an overview of IoTs and how it can be applied to easy navigation of traffic congestions on road networks. One of the major problems among major cities in Africa is that of traffic congestions. In Nigeria, for instance, due to the irregular traffic situations and the conditions of roads in Lagos, it will be appropriate to have a platform where road users can get real time and updated information from a car that had travelled past the road network they are about to travel through; this will provide better decision making and save time when alternative but less cumbersome routes can be navigated. Thus, this paper highlights the possibility and applicability of IoTs at improving road navigation/usage especially in difficult situations.},

abstract={Data aggregation is an efficient technique widely used in Internet of Things (IOT) to collect statistics about data of interest. However, the resource-limited and the inherent unreliability of wireless transmission makes the sensors in the IOT are vulnerable to many attacks. Hence, how to design an efficient and secure data aggregation mechanism becomes critical. In this paper, we present TBSDA-a trust-based secure data aggregation scheme. In TBSDA, secure data aggregation is achieved by behavior-detected trust evaluation and data assembling technique. The trust evaluation and data aggregation work synergistically. We analyze the performance of TBSDA in term of communication overhead and the sensitivity of malicious nodes that behavior abnormally, and compare with other clustering scheme.},

abstract={The range query referring to the Internet of Things is a tough challenge since the data information is fully distributed. In order to support efficient range query, most existing approaches focused on designing the data management mechanism, which ensures that the similar data are stored nearby within the network. However, it will introduce large extra overhead to each peer in the Internet of Things especially when the peers generate data frequently. In this paper, a distributed range query framework is proposed, which consists of three core modules, reporting and indexing module, along with a query executor. The reporting module learns the sensed data and predicts a data range in which the coming future data is likely to be. Only the abnormal data that exceeds the data range will be detected, which greatly reduces the frequency and quantity of data migration in these data management mechanism. The indexing module is responsible for collecting reported data information and establishing data index used for responding to query request. Based on the above two modules, the range query is processed by the query executor. The experimental results show that this proposal could support range query effectively and efficiently, with load balance among the peers at the same time.},

abstract={Object tracking in the Internet of Things (IoT) has become a hot topic over the past ten years. Currently, the integration of video and radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology plays a crucial role in item-level activity recognition. Various techniques and applications have been proposed for visual object tracking. However, identifying semantic features of item-level objects in huge size of video content is a non-trivial task, especially in supply chain management. To alleviate this problem, this paper presents a novel method that applies IoT information to facilitate video summarization. Differing from common video summarization techniques, we use IoT information to select key frames of the video content during the background model establishment. Then we match other key frames with the background to extract important features. Finally, a compact summarization image for queried objects is generated according to a clustering analysis. We have also performed experiments to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed work.},

abstract={We believe that the next big step in the field of Internet of Things (IoT) is to realize a virtual computing platform that provides access to heterogeneous group of device resources present in our living environments. By enabling 3<sup>rd</sup> party developers to access sensor and actuator resources present in a given environment in a same way they can access resources of a single mobile phone, the virtual computing platform would open a new market for the 3<sup>rd</sup> party IoT applications like the smart phones have done for mobile apps. To accomplish this vision, the virtual computing platform must be able to manage resource sharing between applications with differing criticality requirements for ensuring that the whole IoT system runs optimally. The main challenge is that the approach should be generic and extendable for future needs. To tackle this issue, we propose a two-level resource management architecture, where the necessary information about applications and resources are represented with machine-interpretable semantic descriptions based on the Semantic Web technologies. At the system level, these descriptions are used by the global resource manager for allocating resources to the applications based on their criticality and needs. At local level, each device is assigned with a local resource manager that schedules the access to resources provided by the device so that the performance of the more critical applications could be optimized at the expense of the less critical ones. To evaluate our approach in practice, we have implemented a reference implementation of the proposed architecture and demonstrated it through several applications with differing criticality levels. The results are very promising for managing mixed criticality applications in IoT.},

As physical objects around us are able to communicate with one another, the need for human intervention in their operation is reduced. The fulfillment of this concept requires research in the areas of low-power integrated circuits, embedded systems design, network protocols, data analytics, artificial intelligence, and control theory, among others. There has been much advancement in these areas, and the realization of IoT is becoming increasingly probable. In this paper, we discuss new perspectives in systems design under IoT, covering the following key topics: IoT enablers, existing and novel IoT applications, and current challenges in IoT. We first discuss the core technology enablers that have brought us this far in IoT, focusing on the hardware and networking advancements in recent years. Next, we discuss some novel IoT applications that leverage on the technology that is currently available. Finally, we explore some of the potential challenges ahead in IoT. Our discussion seeks to define the IoT foundation that can be built upon for future research in this domain.},

In this paper we present the social approach that the COSMOS project introduces in order to achieve enhanced services like discovery, recommendation and sharing between Things enriched with social properties. We investigate how typical notions and modes of interactions of social networking can be extended to the networks of Things, providing a Social Internet of Things platform, and we discuss two main components supporting the socialization of Things: Social Monitoring and Social Analysis. The first one involves all the main tools and techniques needed for the monitoring of the social properties of the Things, whereas Social Analysis is used for the extraction of their complex social characteristics, as well as models and patterns regarding their behavior and relations between them.},

Nevertheless, the power extracted by such energy harvesters does not provide a large power budget so that circuits in IoT nodes are highly duty cycled. In this paper we study switched-capacitor DC/DC converters as a solution for empowering such IoT nodes in a SoC integration. We specifically give insights about their sizing and show that a systematic sizing methodology is a strong tool enabling fast exploration of the design trade-offs. We also study how multi-mode converters can meet the power needs of IoT SoCs.},

abstract={In recent years, RFID has increasingly been found in our daily life with various applications such as Internet of Things (IoT) and wireless sensor networks. However, considering a large-scale RFID system, collisions occur when multiple tags transmit signals to RFID reader simultaneously, thereby we observe significant degradation of the efficiency of these applications. Besides, in practice, since tags may move into or out of the transmission range of an RFID reader, three different types of tags coexist: dwelling tags, arriving tags, and leaving tags. In this context, it is necessary to design a novel anti-collision protocol which can distinguish them to achieve efficient tag identification. Nevertheless, we observe that existing protocols fail in fully utilizing the differences of the three types of tags. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel protocol, Durable Tree Slotted ALOHA-based protocol (DTSA), to further improve the efficiency obtained in the literature. In general, DTSA distinguishes the three types of tags based on the obtained information from the last identification process. Moreover, DTSA promptly resolves the collisions for the arriving tags and identifies the dwelling tags one-by-one without any collisions. Evaluation results justify that DTSA is more efficient than state-of-the-art protocols.},

abstract={High voltage transmission line is the key equipment in power transmission, but the safety of power transfer is threatened by some indefinitely factors such as natural calamities (hoar frost, hurricane, etc.) and deliberate damage (stealing, destroy, etc.). For these reasons, the on-line monitoring device for the high voltage transmission line is very important to guarantee the operation of power grid. How to send the monitoring data gathered by sensors that are fixed on the transmission line or tower safely and timely to the monitoring center is a very important problem that needs to be solved. Generally the place where the transmission line is set up is far away from cities and sparsely populated, the topographies are varied and complicated, the communication method which can be adopted is limited, at present the choices include general packet radio service (GPRS), optical fiber composite overhead ground wire (OPGW), 3G, etc. these communication technologies can not cover all the areas the transmission line passed, in some area, the radio signal is unstable or even does not work at all, this result in not properly sending the monitoring data back and instability of on-line monitoring data transfer. The sensory ability and communication stability of on-line monitoring devices can be improved obviously by adopting the technology of IoT. In this paper, the communication technologies in the high voltage transmission line IoT are researched and a layered scheme is proposed.},

The key idea is to develop a privacy-aware slotted channel access mechanism using which IoT nodes from multiple operators or trust domains can share wireless channel without mutually exposing their identities, thus alleviating threats from cross-trust-domain traffic analysis geared toward node-profiling, link layer topology estimation, node-tracking, and flow-tracking. The proposed scheme uses a novel zero-exposure slot allocation scheme in which packet transmission timing is the only information that is used for scheduling, collision detection, and collision resolution purposes. In addition to the proposed access scheme, this paper reports the design of a custom hardware unit for implementing the proposed protocol in a test-bed of sensors, emulating IoT networks. Presented results include functional validation and performance of the proposed channel access while preventing complete cross-trust-domain identity exposure.},

abstract={Historically telecommunications companies have measured voice and data traffic for reasons related to service dimensioning and engineering management. Today, personalised devices make it possible to understand not only requirements for the capacity needed in a network environment, but household and individual usage patterns. This has changed the way that companies now market their products and services and sell direct to individual or groups of consumers. Beyond marketing is the intimate knowledge gathered of why people do things, inferred by pattern-of-life data and metadata. This is precise knowledge of customer behaviours, traits, habits and characteristics. Of the most pervasive devices is the smart phone which is carried by most consumers, young and old, everywhere they go. Coupled with additional self-disclosed data in social media, corporations now know a great deal more about people than prior to the mobile Internet revolution. Digital chronicles automatically generated using rich onboard sensors on smartphones gather streams of historical user-based data every single day. The end result is that time-based digital chronicles are now being used to proactively profile individuals and households for more than just telecommunications engineering. The Internet of Things promises even greater connectedness as individual items begin to come alive on a global network each with their respective IP address. Big data will soon be able to reveal patterns and trends that were previously incalculable. Humans in actual fact have become akin to mobile network access nodes, as they move around going about their business, quantified with a variety of measures. We will seek even greater levels of scrutiny in the not-too-distant future heralding in an age of uberveillance. We now know much more about consumers than traditional call holding times and the location of an individual user in a mobile network. Through evidence we know what consumers are thinking, how they are feelin- , and even what they will do next with a high degree of accuracy. Embedded surveillance devices will likely replace clunky mobile and wearable handsets and headsets which will introduce an ability to transcend physical boundaries. This paper will define uberveillance and discuss the limits of connectedness when convenience overrides efficiency. What are the social implications to consumers when companies can exploit the intimate knowledge they collect for more than just service availability?},

This management can be achieved through the use of gateways, i.e., devices that intermediate wireless communications, minimizing resource consumption of the restrained objects. The communication between gateways and objects can be performed over many architectures. Among these architectures, we highlight the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), and the Resource Oriented Architecture (ROA). However, there is a lack of deeper investigations to define which is the best architecture to model the communication between gateways and objects. Therefore, the main contribution of this paper is a quantitative evaluation of SNMP, SOA, and ROA as means for the communication between gateways and objects. Results analysis pointed ROA as the most interesting architecture to model the management communication.},

This is harmful to the machines, especially they are operated by batteries. The Relay Node (RN) in Long-Term Evolution-Advanced (LTE-A) networks is used to enhance the coverage of high data rate and solve the coverage hole problem. Considering the limited energy nature of machines, connecting to the RN instead of the BS is a better choice for cell-edge machines. In this paper, we consider an uplink resource and power allocation problem for energy conservation in LTE-A relay networks. The objective is to minimize the total energy consumption of machines while guarantee their quality of service (QoS). We prove this uplink resource and power allocation problem to be NP-complete and develop an energy-conserved resource and power allocation method to solve the problem. Simulation results show that our algorithm can effectively reduce the energy consumption of machines and guarantee their required service qualities.},

OAuth is a widely deployed protocol -- built on top of HTTP -- for applying FIAM to Web systems. We explore the use of OAuth for IoT systems that instead use the lightweight MQTT 3.1 protocol. In order to evaluate this area, we built a prototype that uses OAuth 2.0 to enable access control to information distributed via MQTT. We evaluate the results of this prototyping activity, and assess the strengths and weaknesses of this approach, and the benefits of using the FIAM approaches with IoT and Machine to Machine (M2M) scenarios. Finally we outline areas for further research.},

We propose and analyze the design notion of adaptive trust management for social IoT systems in which social relationships evolve dynamically among the owners of IoT devices. We reveal the design tradeoff between trust convergence vs. trust fluctuation in our adaptive trust management protocol design. With our adaptive trust management protocol, a social IoT application can adaptively choose the best trust parameter settings in response to changing IoT social conditions such that not only trust assessment is accurate but also the application performance is maximized. We propose a table-lookup method to apply the analysis results dynamically and demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed adaptive trust management scheme with two real-world social IoT service composition applications.},

The SG can spread intelligence of the energy distribution and control system from the central unit to long-distance remote areas, thus enabling accurate state estimation (SE) and wide-area real-time monitoring of these intermittent energy sources. In contrast to the traditional methods of SE, a novel approach for SG SE is proposed based on concatenated coding structures, where the grid state is treated as a dynamic outer code and the recursive systematic convolutional code is seen as a concatenated inner code for protecting and redundancy in the system state. Furthermore, Kalman filter (KF)-based online DERs SE and a discrete-time linear quadratic regulation method are proposed to control these state deviations for the SG and the Internet of Things (IoTs) communication network, which can exploit the far-reaching connectivity and privacy of DERs messages. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves 3 dB performance improvement compared with the existing KF.},

abstract={Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (CP-ABE) is an extremely powerful asymmetric encryption mechanism, it allows to achieve fine-grained access control. However, there is no solution to manage efficiently key/attribute revocation problem in CP-ABE scheme. Key revocation problem is very important in dynamic environment like Internet of Things (IoT), where billions of things are connected together and are cooperating without human intervention. Existing solutions are not efficient due to their overhead (traffic) and complexity (big access trees). Other solutions require the use of powerful semi-trusted proxies to re-encrypt data. The proposed solution in this paper called Batch-Based CP-ABE reduces the complexity and the overhead, and does not require extra nodes in the system. We propose to split time axis into intervals (time slots) and to send only the necessary key parts to allow refreshing the secrets keys. An analysis is conducted on the way to choose the best time slot duration in order to maximize system performances and minimize average waiting time.},

Despite being significantly resource-constrained, IoT nodes are expected to participate in numerous computationally-intensive security protocols to overcome threats from the public Internet. Given that IoT nodes (e.g., smart meters) typically exchange tactical data that requires data protection for a short time span of up to a few days, we examine the use of smaller cryptographic key sizes to provide IoT security. We show that small key sizes quite drastically reduce the cryptographic computational processing requirements for IoT nodes. We estimate the cost of breaking public key crypto systems when the adversary is limited by the available resources (i.e., dollar cost) and time (i.e., number of days). We consider Mooreäó»s law, as well as More than Moore, and Less than Moore technology growth rates, in conjunction with the capabilities of a real-world key-breaker to calculate the cost estimates. Finally, we also present the trade-off between the processing load for an IoT node versus the desired time span of privacy protection.},

In this paper, we propose a model for congestion control in IoT with an improved Random Early Discard (IRED) algorithm. We employ queueing theory to analyze the performance of the proposed control mechanism. We also conduct extensive simulations to evaluate performance of the proposed control and compare it with regular RED algorithm. Our analysis and simulation results show that the proposed control achieves comparable delay performance and better throughput performance compared to standard RED. The simple control mechanism of IRED makes it more suitable to be implemented in IoT.},

abstract={Robust network design against attacks is one of the most fundamental issues in Internet of Things (IoT) architecture as IoT operations highly rely on the support of the underlaying communication infrastructures. In this paper, the vulnerability of IoT infrastructure under intentional attacks is investigated by relating the network resilience to the percolation-based connectivity. Intentional attacks impose severe threats on the network operations as it can effectively disrupt a network by paralyzing a small fraction of nodes, and therefore deteriorating IoT operations. A fusion-based defense mechanism is proposed to mitigate the damage caused by such attacks, where each node feedbacks minimum (one-bit) local decision to the fusion center for attack inference. By formulating the attack and defense strategy as a zero-sum game, the outcome of the game equilibrium is used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism. The robustness of the Internet-oriented and the cyber-physical system (CPS)-oriented networks are specifically analyzed to illustrate the foundation of future IoT infrastructure. Both analytical and empirical results show that the proposed mechanism greatly enhances the robustness of IoT, even in the weak local detection capability and fragile network structure regime.},

abstract={The Internet of Things is expected to be overpopulated by a very large number of objects, with intensive interactions, heterogeneous communications and millions of services. Consequently, scalability issues will arise from the search of the right object that can provide the desired service. A new paradigm known as Social Internet of Things (SIoT) has been introduced and proposes the integration of social networking concepts into the Internet of Things. The underneath idea is that every object can look for the desired service using its friendships, in a distributed manner, with only local information. In the SIoT it is very important to set appropriate rules in the objects to select the right friends as these impact the performance of services developed on top of this social network. In this work we addressed this issue by analyzing possible strategies for the benefit of overall network navigability. We first propose five heuristics which are based on local network properties and that are expected to have an impact on the overall network structure. We then perform extensive experiments, which are intended to analyze the performance in terms of giant components, average degree of connections, local clustering and average path length. Unexpectedly we discovered that minimizing the local clustering in the network allowed for achieving the best results in terms of average path length.We have conducted further analysis to understand the potential causes, which have been found to be linked to the number of hubs in the network.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose a commerce-related architecture, the Smarter Commerce Customer Engagement Architecture (SCCEA). This architecture involves a new definition of the commerce lifecycle and an alternative metric for calculating customer experience and benefit, called customer lifetime benefit (CLB). Traditionally, commerce-related architectures have enabled the direct involvement and interaction between customers and companies from a purchasing, customer support center, or marketing perspective. These systems typically help measure financial success through the customer lifetime value (CLV) metric. SCCEA represents a shift in approaches from these architectures to one focused on the interactions with the products customers own and on how those products are operating. SCCEA analyzes the data gathered directly from the operations of products to make a determination of what actions can be taken to positively influence customer experience. SCCEA is realized through combining three foundational domains: Smarter Commerceä‹¢, Internet of Things, and Customer Engagement. The paper begins with a definition of the commerce lifecycle, followed by an overview of the three foundational domains. With this foundation established, the authors describe the SCCEA architecture, subsystems, and functional components. Finally, to help clarify the feasibility of the SCCEA approach, a representative scenario from the healthcare industry is presented.},

abstract={Context information and context-awareness are some of the drivers for the Internet-of-Things paradigm, whereas a well-stated and defined model is the key element of any context information system. An appropriate context model ensures that the information gathered by a context information system can be represented, manipulated and accessed, and even linked to different systems and domains. This paper highlights the various modeling approaches used in different Internet-of-Things contexts and introduces our module designed especially for application in E-healthcare systems.},

In this paper we present a new protocol which combines zero-knowledge proofs and key exchange mechanisms to provide secure and authenticated communication in static machine-to-machine (M2M) networks. This approach addresses all of the aforementioned issues while also being suitable for devices with limited computational resources and can be deployed in wireless sensor networks. While the protocol requires an a-priori knowledge about the network setup and structure, it guarantees perfect forward secrecy.},

It is not just things connected to the Internet - it is intelligent systems that we will be able to build on top of IoT that will introduce us to a better quality of life. However, IoT is facing a major problem: fragmentation and interoperability problems. If we want things to communicate with each other, intelligently and autonomously, then the new future Internet must be structured to allow such thing. The industry must adopt current standards and provide interoperability among other systems and developers must be aware of this issue too. Every new device should be IoT proof for future integration in IoT.

This work proposes an autonomic architecture for IoT based on IBM's autonomic framework. An accompanying protocol for service communication is also presented.

abstract={Internet of things (IoT) is an emerging paradigm where the devices around us (persistent and non-persistent) are connected to each other to provide seamless communication, and contextual services. In the IoT, each device cannot be authenticated in the short time due to unbounded number of devices. Equally, it is difficult to get receipt of their authentication request at the same time. Therefore, secure, and efficient group authentication scheme is required that authenticates a group of devices at once in the context of resource constrained IoT. This paper presents novel Threshold Cryptography-based Group Authentication (TCGA) scheme for the IoT which verifies authenticity of all the devices taking part in the group communication. The proposed TCGA scheme is implemented for WIFI environment, and the result shows that TCGA scheme is lightweight, and alleviates the effect of battery exhaustion attack. This paper also presents time analysis, and formal security analysis of TCGA scheme which shows that the proposed TCGA scheme is safe from the replay, man-in-the-middle attack, and is scalable in nature.},

abstract={In Internet of Things (IoT), both physical things (such as devices, gateways and commodities etc.) and virtual things (like multimedia content and application software) are assigned unique IoT identifiers (IoT ID), which are similar to the domain name used for locating online resources in Internet. However, until now the format of IoT ID is not globally unified due to all kinds of reasons and thus in the IoT world there are even thousands of types of IoT ID (such as EPC code in USA, uCode in Japan, CPC code in China etc.). Due to the heterogeneity of IoT ID, it becomes the key point of resolving an IoT ID to the information referring to it (just as resolving the domain name to IP address) to at first determine the standard that the given IoT ID belongs to. Towards this issue, an extraction mechanism of IoT ID characteristic is proposed where three kinds of IoT ID characteristics, namely length, value range and special algorithm, are captured from the IoT ID standards. Based on these IoT ID characteristics, a fast IoT ID recognition algorithm is proposed to highly reduce the times of characteristic matching. Then a prototype system is built based on the above algorithm and the experiment results demonstrate that the IoT ID recognition algorithm has a high recognition ratio and low computational complexity.},

abstract={Billions of smart, but constrained objects wirelessly connected to the global network require novel paradigms in network design. New protocol standards, tailored to constrained devices, have been designed taking into account requirements such as asynchronous application traffic, need for caching, and group communication. The existing connection-oriented security architecture is not able to keep up-first, in terms of the supported features, but also in terms of the scale and resulting latency on small constrained devices. In this paper, we propose an architecture that leverages the security concepts both from content-centric and traditional connection-oriented approaches. We rely on secure channels established by means of (D)TLS for key exchange, but we get rid of the notion of the äóìstateäó among communicating entities. We provide a mechanism to protect from replay attacks by coupling our scheme with the CoAP application protocol. Our object-based security architecture (OSCAR) intrinsically supports caching and multicast, and does not affect the radio duty-cycling operation of constrained objects. We evaluate OSCAR in two cases: 802.15.4 Low Power and Lossy Networks (LLN) and Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication for two different hardware platforms and MAC layers on a real testbed and using the Cooja emulator. We show significant energy savings at constrained servers and reasonable delays. We also discuss the applicability of OSCAR to Smart City deployments.},

abstract={Machine-to-machine (M2M) communications enables networked devices to exchange information among each other as well as with business application servers and therefore creates what is known as the Internet-of-Things (IoT). The research community has a consensus for the need of a standardized protocol stack for M2M communications. On the other hand, cognitive radio technology is very promising for M2M communications due to a number of factors. It is expected that cognitive M2M communications will be indispensable in order to realize the vision of IoT. However cognitive M2M communications requires a cognitive radio-enabled protocol stack in addition to the fundamental requirements of energy efficiency, reliability, and Internet connectivity. The main objective of this paper is to provide the state of the art in cognitive M2M communications from a protocol stack perspective. This paper covers the emerging standardization efforts and the latest developments on protocols for cognitive M2M networks. In addition, this paper also presents the authors' recent work in this area, which includes a centralized cognitive medium access control (MAC) protocol, a distributed cognitive MAC protocol, and a specially designed routing protocol for cognitive M2M networks. These protocols explicitly account for the peculiarities of cognitive radio environments. Performance evaluation demonstrates that the proposed protocols not only ensure protection to the primary users (PUs) but also fulfil the utility requirements of the secondary M2M networks.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is a major paradigm shift from traditional Internet applications that connects things / objects to the Internet for automatic sensing, information processing, understanding, reasoning, decision and response to virtual and physical world. Due to its highly distributed and heterogeneous characteristics, it requires more semantic interactions between different scenarios. Therefore, interoperability is one of the most fundamental requirements for IoT systems. Currently, semantic modeling for IoT applications has significant deficiency in its reusability and interoperability. In this paper, we propose a semantic information model for IoT applications, named OntoIoT. This model has a two-level architecture including a set of general upper ontology and flexible interfaces for different application domain ontology extensions. We have preliminarily implemented the OntoIoT framework and domain extension in selected scenarios of smart space and healthcare. A data-driven and other ontology evaluation approaches are used to prove the scalability and interoperability of OntoIoT. Result demonstrates that, compared to other test ontologies, Onto IoT is more suitable for the given application scenario.},

Indeed, Internet of Things, by its heterogeneous nature, may contains highly resource-constrained devices that are not able to support the heavy overhead due to CP-ABE. Further, constrained devices, like sensors, often need to encrypt data as they are usually led to send sensitive data they collect to more powerful devices like storage servers. This paper proposes a novel approach for employing CP-ABE on highly resource-constrained sensor nodes in the IoT environments. The proposed approach exploits collaboration between heterogeneous nodes, to make feasible the implementation of CP-ABE in an IoT environment, by delegating costly operations to a set of assisting nodes. An analysis is conducted to verify that the proposed solution accomplishes safely and efficiently its objective.},

One often proposed solution for dealing with the massive amount of data collected by these devices and offering services on top of them is the federation of the Internet of Things and cloud computing. However, user acceptance of such systems is a critical factor that hinders the adoption of this promising approach due to severe privacy concerns. We present UPECSI, an approach for user-driven privacy enforcement for cloud-based services in the Internet of Things to address this critical factor. UPECSI enables enforcement of all privacy requirements of the user once her sensitive data leaves the border of her network, provides a novel approach for the integration of privacy functionality into the development process of cloud-based services, and offers the user an adaptable and transparent configuration of her privacy requirements. Hence, UPECSI demonstrates an approach for realizing user-accepted cloud services in the Internet of Things.},

abstract={The occurrence of short but recurrent opportunistic contacts between static infrastructure and mobile devices largely characterizes recent Internet of Things (IoT) applications for Smart Cities and Smart Buildings scenarios. In order to efficiently exploit such existing communication opportunities to access services, share and collect data, IoT applications cannot rely on standard discovery mechanisms that periodically probe the environment to discover resources. Discovery protocols resilient to different contact opportunities and able to optimize energy consumption when device contacts are not present are therefore required in order to avoid waste of energy especially in battery operated user devices. Additionally, such new discovery protocols need to optimize the time available for communication operations, while being able to adjust to application requirements, and balance energy consumption with respect to latency for contacts discovery. To this aim, we introduce CARD, a Context Aware Resource Discovery framework that leveraging Q-Learning techniques extends the functionalities of asynchronous neighbor discovery protocols, while being capable to reduce energy wastage and discovery latency. Simulation results show that CARD performs better than existing approaches and is resilient to a variety of real scenarios characterizing Smart Cities and Smart Building deployments.},

Mobility aware solutions increase the connectivity and enhance adaptability to changes of the location and infrastructure. IoT is enabling a new generation of dynamic ecosystems in environments such as smart cities and hospitals. Dynamic ecosystems require ubiquitous access to Internet, seamless handover, flexible roaming policies, and an interoperable mobility protocol with existing Internet infrastructure. These features are challenges for IoT devices, which are usually constrained devices with low memory, processing, communication and energy capabilities. This work has, on the one hand, analysed suitability of Mobile IPv6 and IPSec for constrained devices, and on the other hand, analysed, designed, developed and evaluated a lightweight version of Mobile IPv6 and IPSec. The proposed solution of lightweight Mobile IPv6 with IPSec is aware of the requirements of the IoT and presents the best solution for dynamic ecosystems in terms of efficiency and security adapted to IoT-devices capabilities. This presents concerns in terms of higher overhead and memory requirements. But, it is proofed and concluded that even when higher memory is required and major overhead is presented, the integration of Mobile IPv6 and IPSec for constrained devices is feasible.},

abstract={A complete, though small-scale, end-to-end architecture for the Internet of Things (IoT) is demonstrated by means of a test-bed including: smart objects (both clients and servers) with limited capabilities and proxy devices which allow the latter to connect to a core network, where a peer-to-peer (P2P) overlay is set up and maintained for automatic discovery of resources and highly scalable access. The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is used by smart objects to enable Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications following a resource-oriented approach. Business logic and human interactions with the smart objects for aggregation and visualization, respectively, are also demonstrated, including Android mobile applications.},

abstract={Nowadays, many researchers are interested in the concept of Internet of Things (IoT). IoT is evolving our knowledge and conception of the world. IoT aims to offer a common communication paradigm for all objects via the Internet and its protocols. For that reasons, it is being applied in all areas of life, such as environmental monitoring, healthcare, military, cities management, and industry. One of the major challenges of the IoT is to integrate IPv6, and its related protocols, into the constrained capabilities offered by Wireless Sensor Networks, building automation, and home appliances. One of the design considerations, for the success of the IoT, is to integrate what exists from IPv6, before creating novel protocols, in order to promote and ensure the interoperability, homogeneity, openness, security, flexibility, and heritage of all existing hardware, tools, and applications of IPv6. This work presents how to integrate the management protocols in IPv6 into the emerging IoT networks based on protocols such as 6LoWPAN. An overview of the different management protocols for IPv6 is presented. Network Management Protocol (SNMP), and the considerations for IoT management from works such as Lightweight Network Management Protocol (LNMP), and the Constrained networks and devices Management (COMAN) Group from the IETF are discussed. COMAN is presenting solutions such as simplified MIB, new SNMP consideration, and CoAP-based management.},

This leads to the users bound in a single service provider, poor quality of service, redundancy of the core platform functionality and delay of the whole industry. IoT over IP brings the fundamental support for global communications as well as access to services and information. Several homogenous and seamless machine-to-machine (M2M) communication mechanisms have been proposed to extend the interoperability of smart objects.

Many researches focus on static relationships between IoT objects. However, because complex relationships between various resources change with time in an IoT environment, an efficient method for updating the meta-data is required. Thus, we propose an IoT-DS as the IoT directory that supports semantic description, discovery, and integration of IoT objects. Firstly, we introduce a semantic IoT component model to establish a shared conceptualization. Secondly, we present general cases of relationships to efficiently interact between IoT-DS and IoT objects. Thirdly, we construct IoT-DS as a Web portal. Finally, we verify in our evaluation study that the query processing time and communication workload imposed by the proposed approach are reduced.},

We propose a framework based on the idea that this technology will evolve from monitored ""Things"", to ""Networks of Things"", and ultimately to an ""Internet of Things"".

This paper inspired by Internet of Things concept and presents a way through which electronic circuits and other devices can have a small key integrated with them. The key will be a sort of address for the device. To accomplish this task, we have designed a Fibonacci generator in Xilinx software. The Fibonacci Generator is energy efficient and its role is to generate the key for the communication to take place. The generated key will act as a code for that device. Our analysis records dynamic power consumed for various frequencies by various I/O standards including SSTL18_I, SSTL18_II, HSTL_I and HSTL_II. Then these standards are compared and the best one is selected for making our design of Fibonacci generator to possess green communication and energy efficient.},

However, the IoT inherently challenges software development processes, particularly techniques for ensuring software reliability. Researchers have developed debugging tools for wireless sensor networks (WSNs), which can be viewed as the enablers of perception in the IoT.

Our investigation shows that access control systems for current search and rescue operations are either coarse-grained or computationally heavy. It cannot satisfy the rescue operations since those things demand lightweight cryptographic operations and the participating countries require flexible policies to protect their classified data. We propose a fine-grained access control system which is not only secure but also efficient. The practical experiments are conducted and its results demonstrate the lightweight cost in simulation.},

Hence, we focus on characterizing the kinetic (motion) energy that can be harvested by a wireless node with an IoT form factor and on developing energy allocation algorithms for such nodes. In this paper, we describe methods for estimating harvested energy from acceleration traces. To characterize the energy availability associated with specific human activities (e.g., relaxing, walking, cycling), we analyze a motion dataset with over 40 participants. Based on acceleration measurements that we collected for over 200 hours, we study energy generation processes associated with day-long human routines. We also briefly summarize our experiments with moving objects. We develop energy allocation algorithms that take into account practical IoT node design considerations, and evaluate the algorithms using the collected measurements.

Event processing follows a decoupled model of interaction in space, time, and synchronization. However, the dimension of semantic coupling still exists and poses a challenge to scalability in highly semantically heterogeneous and dynamic environments such as the IoT. Here, the authors describe an approach based on loosely coupled producers and consumers enabled with approximate semantic matching of events.

Integrated Circuits, system and software each had their own distinct suppliers and there was a built-in assumption that customers would be able to äóìmake it workäó. Today, innovative connected products increasingly require a different paradigm where traditional industry definitions are blurred by the realization that the äóìInternet of Every-thingäó requires a more unified knowledge of products and design solutions in areas from devices to servers, software and infrastructure.

abstract={The main aim of this article is giving a picture of the Internet of Things and its benefits, even related to the field of energy. This will be accomplished by describing models, technologies, barriers and examples of energy consumption containment based on smart grid and smart cities vertical applications. Smart grids offer huge potentialities for optimizing the energy consumption thanks to demand-management applications. Those kind of applications can potentially reduce the peak energy usage, usually associated to the most expensive components of the energy bill. For instance, Datacenter operators are extremely interested in that kind of applications because they see the opportunities of reduce drastically their Capital Expenditures (CAPEX). The Internet of Thing could bring enormous opportunities of improvement in the Smart City sector, mainly concerning the management of urban infrastructures such as: traffic flows, lighting, water systems, garbage collection and so on. This involves handling in real time a large amount of context-specific information as well as performing effective post processing of historical data. Public Lighting optimization, Neighborhood Services, traffic paths optimization are immediate examples of such applications in the Smart Cities field. By investing in Smart Cities projects, municipalities could improve both their financial statement and the quality of the life of their citizens. In order to address such huge opportunities the European Commission has planned a roadmap of 12 Billions of Euro until 2020. In this work we summarize at a glance the benefits that Internet of thing could bring in all these fields.},

The essence of the concept of Internet of Things is to interconnect all these heterogeneous and ubiquitous objects among them. Some Smart Cities or Smart Homes allow a part of this concept. But this has a problem, the software that an object needs to be interconnected with the IoT platform. To create this software users need to develop the application and need developer skills. In this paper we propose a solution to this problem. We propose a graphical Domain-Specific Language for creating the necessary software for interconnecting any object with an IoT platform.

However, connecting networked devices with limited user-interaction capabilities and interfaces securely to remote Internet services is challenging. Existing solutions for security pairing, based e.g. on passwords, trusted certification authorities, or physical connection, are not feasible when devices have long distance and have not interfaces for inputting passwords or secrets keys. This paper analyzes approaches for pairing these interface restricted devices. We explore challenges in device pairing in IoT and possibilities to use smartphones as mediators to establish security associations easily. We contribute by analyzing how user-friendly security establishment approaches - out-of-band or unauthenticated location-based pairing - can be applied in situations where a counterparty is far away or has incompatible interfaces.},

Smart devices, which form the backbone of the Internet of Things (IoT), enable alternative forms of user experience by means of automation, convenience, and efficiency. At the same time new security and safety issues arise, given the Internet-connectivity and the interaction possibility of smart devices with human's proximate living space. Hence, security is a fundamental requirement of the IoT design. In order to remain interoperable with the existing infrastructure, we postulate a security framework compatible to standard IP-based security solutions, yet optimized to meet the constraints of the IoT ecosystem. In this ongoing work, we first identify necessary components of an interoperable secure End-to-End communication while incorporating Public-key Cryptography (PKC). To this end, we tackle involved computational and communication overheads. The required components on the hardware side are the affordable hardware acceleration engines for cryptographic operations and on the software side header compression and long-lasting secure sessions. In future work, we focus on integration of these components into a framework and the evaluation of an early prototype of this framework.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is emerging as one of the major trends for the next evolution of the Internet, where billions of physical objects or things (including but not limited to humans) will be connected over the Internet, and a vast amount of information data will be shared among them. However, the current Internet was built on a host-centric communication model, which was primarily designed for meeting the demand of pair-wise peer-to-peer communications and cannot well accommodate various advanced data-centric services boosted by the IoT in which users care about content and are oblivious to locations where the content is stored. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture for the future Internet based on information-centric networking (ICN), which is called DataClouds, to better accommodate data-centric services. Different from existing ICN-based architectures, we take the sharing nature of data-centric services under the IoT into consideration and introduce logically and physically formed communities as the basic building blocks to construct the network so that data could be more efficiently shared and disseminated among interested users. We also elaborate on several fundamental design challenges for the Internet under this new architecture and show that DataClouds could offer more efficient and flexible solutions than traditional ICN-based architectures.},

This innovative concept enables a physical device to represent itself in the digital world. There are a lot of speculations and future forecasts about the Internet of Things devices. However, most of them are vendor specific and lack a unified standard, which renders their seamless integration and interoperable operations. Another major concern is the lack of security features in these devices and their corresponding products. Most of them are resource-starved and unable to support computationally complex and resource consuming secure algorithms. In this paper, we have proposed a lightweight mutual authentication scheme which validates the identities of the participating devices before engaging them in communication for the resource observation.

abstract={Data streams are high volume of multi-dimensional unlabeled data generated in environments such as stock market, astronomical data, Weblogs, Click streams, Flood, Fire and Crops monitoring. Knowledge discovery in data streams is valuable task for research, business and community. The fundamental step of knowledge discovery in data stream is the classification of the data streams in target classes. In this paper we have proposed classification mechanism for the data streams, conventional classification algorithm are of little significance in data streams due to the complex nature, unbounded memory requirements and concept drifting problem in data streams. The proposed method takes a novel approach towards the classification of the data streams through applying unsupervised classification techniques such as clustering followed by supervised classifier such as Support Vector Machine. The high volume data is sampled and reduced with Simple Aggregation and Approximation (SAX) Density based clustering algorithm DB Scan is applied on the data stream to reveal the number of classes present and subsequently label the data. Support vector Machine (SVM) is a well-known and proven supervised classification algorithm, SVM are applied to classify the label data. We tested our proposed method on the Intel Lab Data set, a data set of four environmental variables (Temperature, Voltage, Humidity, light) collected through 54 Mica2Dot sensors over 36 Days at per second rate. We have sampled the data stream in days and window of certain size n is trained on the SVM classifier. The algorithm is evaluated on different test size and average accuracy of 80% is obtained.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) will result in the deployment of many billions of wireless embedded systems creating interactive pervasive environments. It is envisaged that devices will cooperate to provide greater system knowledge than the sum of its parts. In an emergency situation, the flow of data across the IoT may be disrupted, giving rise to a requirement for machine-to-machine interaction within the remaining ubiquitous environment. Geographic hash tables (GHTs) provide an efficient mechanism to support fault-tolerant rendezvous communication between devices. However, current approaches either rely on devices being equipped with a GPS or being manually assigned an identity. This is unrealistic when the majority of these systems will be located inside buildings and will be too numerous to expect manual configuration. Additionally, when using GHT as a distributed data store, imbalance in the topology can lead to storage and routing overhead. This causes unfair work load, exhausting limited power supplies as well as causing poor data redundancy. To deal with these issues, we propose an approach that balances graph-based layout identity assignment, through the application of multifitness genetic algorithms. Our experiments show through simulation that our multifitness evolution technique improves on the initial graph-based layout, providing devices with improved balance and reachability metrics.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) has become an important research topic in the last decade, where things refer to interconnected machines and objects with embedded computing capabilities employed to extend the Internet to many application domains. While research and development continue for general IoT devices, there are many application domains where very tiny, concealable, and non-intrusive Things are needed. The properties of recently studied nanomaterials, such as graphene, have inspired the concept of Internet of NanoThings (IoNT), based on the interconnection of nanoscale devices. Despite being an enabler for many applications, the artificial nature of IoNT devices can be detrimental where the deployment of NanoThings could result in unwanted effects on health or pollution. The novel paradigm of the Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT) is introduced in this paper by stemming from synthetic biology and nanotechnology tools that allow the engineering of biological embedded computing devices. Based on biological cells, and their functionalities in the biochemical domain, Bio-NanoThings promise to enable applications such as intra-body sensing and actuation networks, and environmental control of toxic agents and pollution. The IoBNT stands as a paradigm-shifting concept for communication and network engineering, where novel challenges are faced to develop efficient and safe techniques for the exchange of information, interaction, and networking within the biochemical domain, while enabling an interface to the electrical domain of the Internet.},

When the person's context changes, they have to manually reconfigure the parameters. What was meant to be a commodity in an unforeseen situation then becomes extra noise.

This is a difficult task to help users build generic IoT applications to combine several domains. To explicitly describe sensor measurements in uniform way, we propose to enrich them with semantic web technologies. Domain knowledge is already defined in more than 200 ontology and sensor-based projects that we could reuse to build cross-domain IoT applications. There is a huge gap to reason on sensor measurements without a common nomenclature and best practices to ease the automation of generic IoT applications. We present our Machine-to-Machine Measurement (M3) framework and share lessons learned to improve existing standards such as oneM2M, ETSI M2M, W3C Web of Things and W3C Semantic Sensor Network.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) platforms that handle Big Data might perform poorly or not according to the goals of their operator (in terms of costs, database utilization, data quality, energy-efficiency, throughput) if they are not configured properly. The latter configuration refers mainly to system parameters of the data-collecting gateways, e.g., polling intervals, capture intervals, encryption schemes, used protocols etc. However, re-configuring the platform appropriately upon changes of the system context or the operator targets is currently not taking place. This happens because of the complexity or unawareness of the synergies between system configurations and various aspects of the Big Data-handling IoT platform, but also because of the human resources that an efficient re-configuration would require. This paper presents an auto-configuration solution based on interpretable configuration suggestions, focusing on the algorithms for computing the mentioned suggested configurations. Five such algorithms are contributed, while a thorough evaluation reveals which of these algorithms should be used in different operation scenarios in order to achieve high fulfillment of the operator's targets.},

Such tools allow them to retrieve the data they want without knowing the underlying technical details of the sensors and the data processing components. We propose a Context Aware Sensor Configuration Model (CASCoM) to address the challenge of automated context-aware configuration of filtering, fusion, and reasoning mechanisms in IoT middleware according to the problems at hand. We incorporate semantic technologies in solving the above challenges. We demonstrate the feasibility and the scalability of our approach through a prototype implementation based on an IoT middleware called Global Sensor Networks (GSN), though our model can be generalized into any other middleware platform. We evaluate CASCoM in agriculture domain and measure both performance in terms of usability and computational complexity.},

abstract={Building automation is concerned with monitoring and control of building services equipment. Over the last years, many different control network protocols have materialized for this task. Ideally, an all-in-one solution would be desired which allows total control of all conceivable scenarios. Even despite the long timespan of development, no single specific protocol has yet emerged that covers all application domains. Rather, many different protocols co-exist that rarely interact. For purposes of management-level system integration, a common, preferably open format for access to data points which is aligned with IT standards is a key asset. Following the current trends in information technology, Web Services for machine-to-machine interaction over a network seem to be a reasonable choice here. Based on them, an integration into the future Internet of Things (IoT) can be achieved. The IoT thereby promises to provide a dynamic global network infrastructure with self configuring capabilities resting upon interoperable communication protocols. This paper will focus on challenges and approaches allowing a cross-domain interaction of building automation systems while at the same time discussing their seamless integration into the IoT.},

We point out that there is now much more agreement on the approach to basic services, and a more universal approach to adaption. While universal adoption of common technologies is still far distant, there has been a broad consensus on the use of the Internet and web services for the access to such systems.

abstract={This paper describes an approach for a congestion charge system architecture based on a model of Internet of Things. This proposal is made in order to address the problems caused by the growth of traffic congestion on road infrastructure that supports a city. The vision of the architecture is the divided in two components: the vehicular detection component and the processing and analysis component. The first of these is related to the network of distributed and autonomous hardware used to monitor and detect vehicles that enter to a cost congestion area. The second component is responsible for the logical operations business of the system. The document shows advantages of the model of Internet of Things for a Congestion Charges System and other associated challenges.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is a concept that considers the pervasive presence of things or objects/equipment that communicate through wireless, cable connections and can interact with each other and can collaborate with other things or objects, to create new services and medical applications in order to achieve common objectives (diagnosis, treatment, patient rehabilitation). Considering that the Android operating system allows data storage, connectivity, Web browser, media support, development environment, we propose to develop an application that will come in support to any patient who is suffering from hypotension/hypertension, diabetes, obesity, or other metabolic diseases associated, and even more for patients with vision impairments who are unable to be independent. With the help of such application the patients and physicians can monitor measured values of blood pressure, values of blood glucose, weight, body mass index, cholesterol, etc., having the possibility of creating a database and a medical history, in which the values specified by the medical devices are stored on the smartphone using Bluetoothä‹¢ technique. In this paper we developed an application on the Android platform which aims at recording data measured (SBP - Systolic Blood Pressure, DBP - Diastolic Blood Pressure and Heart Rate) by the electronic sphygmomanometer which communicates using Bluetoothä‹¢ technique. The application offers the possibility of transmitting medical data via mobile Internet or wireless. Data will be compared with standard values and if these values are not in the normal range, the patient is alerted, including family doctor, or in the worst case the emergency service.},

A theoretical framework of such an IoT is presented and discussed in this paper. Each object of the IoT has a power demand and a priority, and it is interconnected and able to exchange information with all other objects in the system. As each object shares information (its power demand and priority) with the other objects, the system as a whole gains self-governance, or is able to be managed without a centralized controller. Our model of such an IoT also gives four applicable algorithms describing the behavior of the objects, along with analyses of correctness and performance.},

Unfortunately, the huge number of mobile objects which will be included in the IoT can result in a significant amount of signaling traffic for the purpose of location discovery and update. The major contributions of this paper are based on a simple evidence: in most IoT scenarios several objects move together as they are carried by a human or a vehicle, i.e., a phenomenon that we refer to as object group mobility (OGM) naturally emerges. OGM can be exploited to reduce signaling traffic and to improve the accuracy of object localization. More specifically, in this paper: i) we introduce the OGM concept and explain how, by means of a collective agent representing a group of objects as whole, it is possible to reduce signaling traffic and improve accuracy in object localization; ii) we derive an analytical framework to assess the advantages of the proposed approach; iii) we validate the analytical framework through extensive simulations.},

In the evolution of Internet towards new paradigms like Internet of Things (IoT), protection of privacy can be a challenging task because IoT connected objects can generate an enormous amount of data, some of which actually constitute personal data. In addition, it is difficult to control the flow of data when there is no user interface or adequate tools for the user. In this paper we describe an efficient solution to enforcement security policy rules that addresses this challenge, and takes a more general enterprise architecture approach for security and privacy engineering in IoT. This enforcement solution is based on a Model-based Security Toolkit named SecKit, and its integration with the MQ Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol layer, which is a widely adopted technology to enable the communication between IoT devices. In this paper, we describe the motivation and design of our enforcement solution, demonstrating its feasibility and the performance results in a case study.},

abstract={Internet of things is an emerging technology that aims to connect various smart objects in our daily life. It facilitates the information exchange and control among objects. In the Internet of things, it is important to discover various relations among objects for analyzing and mining useful knowledge. Existing works on relation discovery mainly focus on centralized processing. It is not suitable for Internet of things due to unavailable of server, one-point failure, computation bottleneck, and security and business concerns. In this paper, we propose a distributed approach to discover the relations among objects in Internet of things. We first build the distritbuted system model which may include multiple relation discovery tasks. Based on that, we design an approach utilizing distributed spanning tree to extract the relations. Rather than sending all the information to the server, the objects only need to send the information to a local leader object in our algorithm. We also discuss more about how to improve the performance of the proposed approach and how to relax the system constraints. Extensive simulation have been done and the results show that the proposed approach outperforms existing approaches in terms of the data amount of transmission.},

Privacies are classified into three security levels and each level has its security goal respectively. The Baidu search engine is taken as the research platform of collecting related data.

In this work, we address the location privacy issue by introducing the Semantic Obfuscation technique (S-Obfuscation). This technique, compared to classical geometric-based obfuscation techniques, relies on geographic knowledge to produce obfuscated locations that are harder to be detected as fake or obfuscated by an adversary. The obfuscation process is supported by our novel use of ontological classification of locations based on a geographical knowledge.},

abstract={Public transit is one of the most important service sectors of a modern city to satisfy people's intra-city transportation requirements. Dynamic bus dispatching in transit system plays a very important role since it is directly related to the daily operations of a transit agency. The main difficulty of dynamic bus dispatching lies in the fact that a lot of exceptional events or factors are required to be efficiently processed in transit system based on the current bus running plan and crew allocation plan. In the literature papers on dynamic bus dispatching, the assumption that bus timetables on stops are pre-determined may not be true for many developing countries, and a set of state space variables corresponding to real time environment information related to transit system is not fully integrated into the dynamic bus dispatching models. In this paper, a new approach for dynamic bus dispatching under the Internet of things environment is proposed. Based on the real time passenger flows and bus arriving time on stops, an optimization model with the objective of minimizing total passenger waiting time is established. A memory-based genetic algorithm is developed to solve the model under dynamically evolved environment. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified under different scenarios via simulation study.},

However, there is a current trend to involve small embedded systems (so called Internet of Things devices) integrated into such distributed control systems. To this end, we seek to address the outsets for real-time execution of Function Block based designs onto light-weight controllers (MCUs) with limited resources (memory and CPU).

abstract={The growing interest in the Internet of Things (IoT) has resulted in a number of wide-area deployments of IoT subnetworks, where multiple heterogeneous wireless communication solutions coexist: from multiple access technologies such as cellular, WiFi, ZigBee, and Bluetooth, to multi-hop ad-hoc and MANET routing protocols, they all must be effectively integrated to create a seamless communication platform. Managing these open, geographically distributed, and heterogeneous networking infrastructures, especially in dynamic environments, is a key technical challenge. In order to take full advantage of the many opportunities they provide, techniques to concurrently provision the different classes of IoT traffic across a common set of sensors and networking resources must be designed. In this paper, we will design a software-defined approach for the IoT environment to dynamically achieve differentiated quality levels to different IoT tasks in very heterogeneous wireless networking scenarios. For this, we extend the Multinetwork INformation Architecture (MINA), a reflective (self-observing and adapting via an embodied Observe-Analyze-Adapt loop) middleware with a layered IoT SDN controller. The developed IoT SDN controller originally i) incorporates and supports commands to differentiate flow scheduling over task-level, multi-hop, and heterogeneous ad-hoc paths and ii) exploits Network Calculus and Genetic Algorithms to optimize the usage of currently available IoT network opportunities. We have applied the extended MINA SDN prototype in the challenging IoT scenario of wide-scale integration of electric vehicles, electric charging sites, smart grid infrastructures, and a wide set of pilot users, as targeted by the Artemis Internet of Energy and Arrowhead projects. Preliminary simulation performance results indicate that our approach and the extended MINA system can support efficient exploitation of the IoT multinetwork capabilities.},

abstract={Augmented reality (AR) is a promising technology for building applications in an Internet of Things (IoT) environment, utilized for visualizing information provided by IoT devices. In this paper, we enable Web-based mobile AR applications with mobile agents in a resource-oriented IoT system architecture. We present an adaptable mobile agent composition that contains the data representation logic and mappings between AR applications and system resources. Thus, mobile agents and AR application-specific data structures are exposed as global system resources. System resource linkages are considered between real-world objects and their virtual representations for mobile agent-based AR applications. The agent composition also complies with the REST principles for resource access and control system-wide. This allows dynamic runtime adaptation and addressing the device and resource heterogeneity, thus eliminating the need for application-specific communication protocols. Moreover, we utilize a Web-based mobile AR application framework, running completely in a Web browser, which facilitates straightforward AR application development. Lastly, a proof of concept mobile AR application is implemented, where a coffee maker with a visual tag is connected to a low-power resource-constrained wireless sensor network node as an IoT device. A mobile agent is injected into the IoT environment to expose the state changes of the coffee maker. Through the visual tag, AR applications are able to visualize the state changes of the coffee maker in their user interface.},

abstract={Nowadays, the Internet connects more objects than people. These devices generate vast amounts of information. Furthermore, identification technologies - such as Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) - enable the association of information with identifiable objects, not necessarily connected to the Internet. All this information is organized into vertical silos. These silos usually belong to different administrative domains and use their own specific communication protocols. In this paper, we present our vision for a global, all-encompassing Internet of Things (IoT) realized through an integrating architecture relying on information and its identifiers/names. We envision the IoT as the architecture that will interconnect all these silos and will make the information generated by or associated with objects globally accessible. Moreover, we argue that the Information-Centric Networking (ICN) paradigm is the ideal candidate architecture for the realization of that IoT vision. In line with this premise, we propose a research agenda for the realization of a full-fledged ICN-based IoT architecture.},

Context-aware communications and computing have played a critical role throughout the last few years of ubiquitous computing and are expected to play a significant role in the IoT paradigm as well. In this paper, we examine a variety of popular and innovative IoT solutions in terms of context-aware technology perspectives. More importantly, we evaluate these IoT solutions using a framework that we built around well-known context-aware computing theories. This survey is intended to serve as a guideline and a conceptual framework for context-aware product development and research in the IoT paradigm.

Contrary to past research efforts, our proposal is transparent and compatible both with the underlying low-layer protocols and diverse applications, and preserving energy-efficiency in the long run without sacrificing the QoI levels attained. In particular, we first introduce the novel concept of QoI-aware sensor-to-task relevancy to explicitly consider the sensing capabilities offered by a sensor to the IoT sensory environments, and QoI requirements required by a task. Second, we propose a novel concept of the critical covering set of any given task in selecting the sensors to service a task over time. Third, energy management decision is made dynamically at runtime, to reach the optimum for long-term application arrivals and departures under the constraint of their service delay. We show a case study to utilize sensors to perform environmental monitoring with a complete set of performance analysis. We further consider the signal propagation and processing latency into the proposal, and provide a thorough analysis on its impact on average measured delay probability.},

Most existing routing protocols are not designed considering the dense architecture of IoT. It is a great challenge to render these algorithms adaptive to the changing requirements of sensor-based IoT applications since their routing policies are mostly predetermined. Thus, they are not energy efficient and fault tolerant for such mobility centric IoT.

Their massive adoption and use is expected to increase further, making them important components of the Future Internet. A novel paradigm where Cloud and IoT are merged together is foreseen as disruptive and an enabler of a large number of application scenarios. In this paper we focus our attention on the integration of Cloud and IoT, which we call the CloudIoT paradigm. Many works in literature have surveyed Cloud and IoT separately: their main properties, features, underlying technologies, and open issues. However, to the best of our knowledge, these works lack a detailed analysis of the CloudIoT paradigm. To bridge this gap, in this paper we review the literature about the integration of Cloud and IoT. We start analyzing and discussing the need for integrating them, the challenges deriving from such integration, and how these issues have been tackled in literature. We then describe application scenarios that have been presented in literature, as well as platforms -- both commercial and open source -- and projects implementing the CloudIoT paradigm. Finally, we identify open issues, main challenges and future directions in this promising field.},

Recently, many NoSQL systems (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra, HBASE) have been born for coping the scalability issues of current analysis approaches. They all are based on different data models and present different performances based on structure, size and location of data distributed on clusters. While the research community is really active in the development of techniques for big data analysis, at current stage a comprehensive solution that supports the user in loading data from heterogeneous sources and in integrating them into the most suitable NoSQL system is still lacking. In this paper we propose the design and expected functionalities of Big Loader, a user-friendly loading system for NoSQL systems that allows the specification of the conceptual schema of the data to be loaded, the specification of the sources from which the data should be gathered in order to feed the conceptual schema and finally we outline intelligent strategies for the selection of the NoSQL system where the conceptual scheme can be deployed.},

abstract={Internet of Things has the potential to disrupt industries through changing products, services, and business models just as the Internet did in the '90s. Machine-to-machine communication is at the core of Internet of Things. Machines that we interact with in everyday life will start interacting with each other, collect data, and even use advances in data technologies to make decisions for us. Organizations, in order to achieve the highest profit, should also redesign their business service models conscientiously around externalities across markets that link through platforms and be specific about which markets to serve. In this research, we aim to build business ownership strategies to further two-sided markets and platforms literature. Herein, we focus on a number of business service models that link four sides of a market, and compare the advantages and disadvantages of network externalities generated by Internet of Things in each model.},

abstract={I-Health can be defined as äóìintelligent system and android, wireless communications technologies for health-care.äó This emerging concept represents the evolution of I-Health systems from traditional desktop äóìtelemedicineäó platforms to wireless and mobile configurations. The interest in I-Health systems (IHS) originates initially from the need to extend health services out of the hospital and monitor patients over extensive periods of time. Intelligent IHS are integrated systems in contact with or near the body able to sense, process and communicate biomedical, biochemical and physical parameters. Current and emerging developments in wireless sensors communications integrated with developments in pervasive and android technologies will have a radical impact on future health-care delivery systems. This editorial paper presents a snapshot of recent developments in these areas and addresses some of the challenges and future implementation issues from the I-Health perspective. The contributions presented in this special section represent some of these recent developments and illustrate the multidisciplinary nature of this important and emerging concept.},

This approach uses thing-to-thing or thing-to-gateway connections to access the Internet of Things, allowing data to be stored for cross-referencing and accessing services, such as remote home sensors, etc. In order to make these ubiquitous networks available in the home, power line communication is used. These lines carry data simultaneously with AC electric power. Power lines connect heterogeneous devices through private electrical networks, allowing greater flexibility in the deployment of applications that require important data transfer. Broadband access and advancements in ubiquitous computing have fostered the development of power line communication offering integrated services through a reliable and robust system at the physical and data link layer of the open system interconnection (OSI) model.

The proposed scheme is dubbed as subcarrier index coordinate expression (SICE), which utilizes the indices of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) subcarriers and waveforms with different phase shifts to represent the information to be sent. SICE is targeted for IoT applications with low data rate requirements, and is especially useful for battery-powered IoT devices demanding low-power communications, due to its characteristics of low peak to average power ratio (PAPR) and high power efficiency in wireless transmission. Unlike ongoing efforts in IoT wireless communications at standardization organizations which focus on simplifying functionalities of the existing protocols to save power, the technique developed in this paper is a fundamentally new and yet OFDM-compatible physical-layer approach that can drastically reduce power consumption of data transmission.},

Adding to this, emerging technology like Internet-of-Things (IoT) wherein a large number of devices are getting connected to the Internet, thereby accelerating the rate of data generation. There are also future predictions that the number of devices connected to the internet is going to exceed the number of people connected to the internet. So there occurs the necessity to harness this large amount of data (mostly sensor data), convert them into useful information, make intelligent predictions and use this knowledge to build robust systems. In this paper we demonstrate the idea to build an Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) using the Internet of Things (IoT) platform. The system has three components ; the sensor system, monitoring system and the display system. The sensor system has Global Positioning System (GPS), Near Field Communication (NFC), Temperature and Humidity sensors, which are always connected with the internet via a GSM network to track the location, commuter and ambience inside the bus. The monitoring system is used to extract the raw data from the sensors database, convert it in to a meaningful context, triggers some events with in the bus and provide information to the bus driver. The display system is used to show the context data (bus and travel related information) to all the commuters in the bus stop. We describe our prototype and show how this can be used as a fundamental component to build the ITS.},

A secure and able connection will be required to connect either a cloud based or an in-house server to the embedded sensors. The ability to ensure that the data generated by the sensor networks is securely streamed to the central server will allow for real time access to the data.

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as a paradigm in which smart things actively collaborate among them and with other physical and virtual objects available in the Web in order to perform high-level tasks. IoT environments are typically characterized by a high degree of heterogeneity, thus encompassing devices with different capabilities, functionalities, and network protocols. In such a scenario, it is necessary to provide abstractions for physical devices and services to applications and end-users, as well as means to manage the interoperability between such heterogeneous elements. In this context, we introduce EcoDiF (Web Ecosystem of Physical Devices), a Web-based platform for integrating heterogeneous physical devices with applications and users in order to provide services to support real-time data control, visualization, processing, and storage. In this paper, we present the main features of EcoDiF and detail its architecture and implementation, which is based on well-known Web technologies such as HTTP, REST, EEML, and EMML. Furthermore, we present a preliminary evaluation of an EcoDiF prototype through proof-of-concept applications from different domains as well as a performance analysis of the platform.},

Since the PIoT is a huge complex cyber-physical network, the study on the security of PIoT, especially the influence of the perception layer, is of importance from both the architecture and measures. Considering about the huge numbers of new technologies and intelligent devices, we propose a global perspective security framework from perception layer to application layer.

abstract={In recent years, with the rapid expansion of China railway construction which accelerate the increasing numbers of railroad monitoring station and the development of the Internet of Things, the lightning protection of railway becomes more intelligent and informative. Especially in China railway 5T system (railway vehicle running safety monitor system), technologies such as the mechanical, acoustic, optical, electronic, infrared monitoring help to monitor and guarantee the train safety during running. There are more than 6,000 stations in 5T system, these stations are mostly located in the wilderness, mountains range, wetlands, coastal and other harsh environment. Consequently, lightning damage and maintenance costs amount to more than 10 million Yuan each year. Since 2003, the lightning protection devices had been installed in 5T system stations including power lightning protection devices and signal lightning protection devices. The implementation of integrated lightning protection measures these status: lightning protection, grounding, and equipotential connection and so on. However there is not any stationed staff in the station, and the station does not have trigger response to any immediate notification after lightning damage occurs. In this case, the lightning protection lacks intelligent protection, which can mitigate the possibility of future lightning damage. In order to make the 5T system lightning protection effectively work on the purpose of centralized management, we introduce the technology of the ""Internet of Things"". Thousands of data about lightning currents, SPD information, power information, grounding system state information are connected through the wireless network to the information management platform. Through several years' running and testing, 5T system maintenance personnel and the Railway Bureau management personnel can obtain lightning protection informations of 5T system at real time which greatly improves the effectiveness of lightn- ng protection equipment and facilities further minimizing the costs of lightning damage.},

abstract={With the emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) vision, RFID technology has attracted more and more interests from many industries. In the EPCglobal standard which standardizes RFID architectural framework and interfaces, the Electronic Product Code Information System (EPCIS) - the repository in the RFID network - plays a pivotal role in storing dynamic and historical RFID trajectory data, well-tailored to supply chain applications. However, in the IoT era, EPCIS should be capable of storing a large amount of realtime and continuous time-series RFID data in a scalable manner. Therefore, in this paper, we analyze the requirements and current design of EPCIS and report current limitations of SQL-based approaches for IoT applications. To cope with these limitations, we explore a NoSQL-based approach for EPCIS in the IoT and propose a column-family-based data model and customization for Cassandra-based EPCIS. Using real-world implementation, we also conduct a performance comparison between MySQL and Cassandra in different deployment scenarios (i.e., physical and virtual machines). As a result, we show the benefits of using Cassandra datastore for EPCIS in the IoT in terms of response time, throughput, and flexibility.},

In this paper, we explain a number of existing approaches in the mobile ecosystem and mention the research challenges for applying those approaches to one of the well-known operating systems in the IoT ecosystem, i.e., Contiki OS. The main problem is that operating systems for constrained devices in the IoT are quite limited and do not provide any memory protection or virtualization support. As the main contribution, we propose our novel approach for providing fine-grained access controls in Contiki OS under these constraints.},

However, few researches about trust mechanism for Internet of Things (IoT) could be found in the literature, though we argue that considerable necessity is held for applying trust mechanism to IoT. In this paper, we establish a formal trust management control mechanism based on architecture modeling of IoT. We decompose the IoT into three layers, which are sensor layer, core layer and application layer, from aspects of network composition of IoT. Each layer is controlled by trust management for special purpose: self-organized, affective routing and multi-service respectively. And the final decision-making is performed by service requester according to the collected trust information as well as requester' policy. Finally, we use a formal semantics-based and fuzzy set theory to realize all above trust mechanism, the result of which provides a general framework for the development of trust models of IoT.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) application layer protocols are gaining popularity in a wide range of scenarios, where low-cost, low-power or resource constrained devices are present. The most diffused protocols are the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) and MQTT. In order to ensure message delivery, CoAP features a retransmission mechanism based on exponential back-off and a finite number of retransmissions, while MQTT relies on TCP. In remote areas lacking fixed terrestrial network infrastructure, the only available Internet access technology is often represented by wireless or satellite links, usually affected by losses and significant delay. At this time, there is no information about MQTT and CoAP performance over high delay links in the literature. The goal of this paper is to provide a quantitative performance analysis of the mentioned IoT protocols over various conditions of offered traffic, packet loss probability and delay. Our findings show that, with default protocol parameters, MQTT offers better performance in terms of throughput in any of the considered scenarios. As far as latency is concerned, CoAP slightly outperforms MQTT in case of low offered traffic, low loss probability and high delay. We suggest to tune CoAP parameters in order to cope with high traffic and high loss probability: the new parameters result in improved latency and throughput in those conditions.},

However, the single conversion ratio (CR) CP has a narrow input voltage range. This induces a charge redistribution loss (CRL) and becomes a bottleneck preventing highly efficient energy harvesting [2]. CRL stems from two facts: 1) The operating voltages of energy sources vary with environment, and 2) Different energy sources feature a wide range of output voltages. By tuning the CR as one dimension, reconfigurable CPs can eliminate CRL; however, they need complex control algorithms, lack maximum power point tracking (MPPT) [3], and only provide fractional ratios [4]. Thus, they are not preferable for energy harvesting from various sources.},

abstract={More than 50 billion devices are expected to be internet enabled by 2020 [1]. These devices, commonly referred to as the ""Internet of Things"" (IoT), are expected to become ubiquitous and involved in every aspect of life, ranging from wearable devices to sensors monitoring industrial processes. The networking equipment connecting these devices will need to seamlessly communicate with several different software platforms, with software continuously upgraded. In addition, these devices will be exposed to unprecedented, highly varying external stimuli: harsh thermal fluctuations, fluids, moisture, vibrations and shock. Networking products have traditionally been protected in data centers, where temperature, humidity and vibrations are well controlled, and software upgrades well managed with significant redundancy. Traditional networking devices are not designed for use in the unpredictable, varying environments that devices supporting the IoT ecosystem will endure. A paradigm shift is needed, to develop new methodologies to characterize and estimate the system level reliability of these devices. Traditional Telecom industry requirements for hardware reliability are ""5 Nines"": 99.999%, which translates to 5 minutes and 15 seconds of downtime in a year. Software reliability is typically expected to be 99.95%, which translates to 1 day, 19 hours and 48 minutes in a year of down time. The combined reliability of a system will need to incorporate hardware and software reliability and capture the interaction between the two. Moreover, the product can be designed to be ""self-aware"" such that it can adapt to changing use environments to maintain target reliability. In this paper, we will present a new methodology for estimating hardware and software reliability given uncertain use conditions, to derive probabilistic estimates for overall system reliability. The methodology is applied to illustrative case studies: estimating the impact of temperature variation on the reliabilit- of two component types in a typical networking product: solder joint interconnects and fans. The methodology is then extended to software applications in a networking product, capturing the effects of distinct variables: interaction between hardware and software, resource consumption (memory, processing, graphics etc.) and the delay between software and hardware updates. Numerical Finite Element Models (FEM) are combined with statistical techniques and Monte Carlo simulations to develop a reliability prediction framework/approach. An analytical framework is outlined to capture the asynchronous variation of software upgrades with hardware changes. The models developed can then be used to perform sensitivity studies to determine which factors are most influential in degrading reliability, and rank ordering them. This in turn can help identify the specific issue (hardware component or software issue) to focus on, to meet target reliability goals. The models can also be used to derive the optimal design window, which engineers can then use to design their IoT products while ensuring their reliability targets are met. Engineers can determine for instance, the optimal frequency of firmware updates, improve resource allocation for reliability etc. Finally, an overall framework will be presented, on how this methodology can be extended to any electronic system in the IoT ecosystem and beyond.},

We conducted a performance evaluation of the considered database systems through extensive experiments in the cloud.

abstract={The current situation of technology separation among the different application domains of the Internet of Things (IoT) results in a market separation per application domain. This issue hinders the technical innovation and investments in the IoT business. In order to solve the issue, it is necessary to standardize common technologies of the IoT across the different application domains. This paper argues that the key direction of the future standardization of the IoT is not standardizing specific technologies, but building over a standardized new architecture reference model for the IoT. Based on the analysis of existing key activities concerning the standardization of OSI, NGN and IoT from a functional architecture perspective, it suggests that the IoT standardization work be progressed in an evolutionary way in order to enable the integration of existing technologies, and focus on the interactions among the functional entities of the IoT to impose minimum constraints on future technical innovations.},

In this paper, we focus on how to assign the crowdsourcing sensing tasks based on the credible interaction between users. First, a novel credible crowdsourcing assignment model is proposed based on social relationship cognition and community detection. Second, the service quality factor, link reliability factor, and region heat factor are introduced to scientifically evaluate the user crowdsourcing preferences. And then, a crowdsourcing algorithm based on Analytic Hierarchy Process theory is proposed. Finally, the simulation experiments prove the correctness, effectiveness, and robustness of our method.1},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-physical Systems (CPS) are two very hot research topics today, and more and more products are starting to appear on the market. Research has shown that the use of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) can enable distributed application and devices to device communication, even on very resource constrained devices, and thus play an important role for IoT and CPS. In order to realize the vision of Internet of Things, communication between devices must be secured. Security mechanisms for resource constrained devices has attracted much interest from the academic community, where research groups have shown solutions like IPsec, VPN-tunnels, (D)TLS, etc. are feasible to use on this type of networks. However, even though the use of well-known security mechanisms are vital for SOA-based IoT/CPS networks and systems to be protected, they do not provide any fine-grain access control. In this paper, a CoAP-based framework for service-level access control on low-power devices is presented. The framework allows fine grain access control on a per service and method basis. For example, by using this approach a device can allow read/write access to its services to one group of users while only allowing read access to another group. Users without the right credentials are not even allowed to discover available services. To demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach, several implementations are presented together with test results. The aim is to provide a holistic framework for secure SOA-based low power networks comprise by resource constrain devices.},

Various range application of blowfish algorithm can be implemented for data encryption sent from an Internet of Things physical network which have IP-based data. In this research, blowfish algorithm is implemented on FPGA using VHDL programming language, and monitored the number of FPGA resource that is used. The blowfish algorithm is analyzed by computing certain metrics performances such as security, encryption time, avalanche effect, and throughput from multiple testing scenarios for system reliability. The testing showed that blowfish algorithm gave a good performance when implemented in FPGA and show a good alternative to proposed as network security on Internet of Things.},

To leverage the IoT, redundant development should be avoided and maintenance costs should be reduced. In this paper we revisit the requirements for an OS in the IoT. We introduce RIOT OS, an OS that explicitly considers devices with minimal resources but eases development across a wide range of devices. RIOT OS allows for standard C and C++ programming, provides multi-threading as well as real-time capabilities, and needs only a minimum of 1.5 kB of RAM.},

abstract={The term Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the interaction and communication between billions of devices that produce and exchange data related to real world objects (i.e. Things). Extracting higher-level information from the raw sensory data captured by the devices and representing this data as machine-interpretable or human-understandable information has several interesting applications. Deriving raw data into higher-level information representations demands mechanisms to find, extract and characterise meaningful abstractions from the raw data. This meaningful abstractions then have to be presented in a human and/or machineunderstandable representation. However, the heterogeneity of the data originated from different sensor devices and application scenarios such as e-health, environmental monitoring and smart home applications and the dynamic nature of sensor data make it difficult to apply only one particular information processing technique to the underlying data. A considerable amount of methods from machine-learning, the semantic web, as well as pattern and data mining have been used to abstract from sensor observations to information representations. This paper provides a survey of the requirements and solutions and describes challenges in the area of information abstraction and presents an efficient workflow to extract meaningful information from raw sensor data based on the current state-of-the-art in this area. The paper also identifies research directions at the edge of information abstraction for sensor data. To ease the understanding of the abstraction workflow process, we introduce a software toolkit that implements the introduced techniques and motivates to apply them on various data sets.},

abstract={In the last few years, Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) emerges and appears as an essential platform for prominent concept of Internet of Things (IoT). Their application ranges from so-called äóìsmart citiesäó, äóìsmart homesäó over environmental monitoring. The connectivity in IoT mainly relies on RPL (IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Network) - a routing algorithm that constructs and maintains DODAGs (Destination Oriented Directed Acyclic Graph) to transmit data from sensors to root over a single path. However, due to the resource constraints of sensor nodes and the unreliability of wireless links, single-path routing approaches cannot be considered effective techniques to meet the performance demands of various applications. In order to overcome these problems, many individuals and group research focuses on multi-path solutions for RPL routing protocol. In this paper, we propose three multipath schemes based on RPL (Energy Load Balancing-ELB, Fast Local Repair-FLR and theirs combination-ELB-FLR) and integrate them in a modified IPv6 communication stack for IoT. These schemes are implemented in OMNET++ simulator and the experiment outcomes show that our approaches have achieved better energy efficiency, better end-to-end delay, packet delivery rate and network load balance compared to traditional solution of RPL.},

The devices are treated as black box devices and little work has been done to quantify the performance of these devices when the system architecture, software components or communication channels are varied. This paper introduces micro- and macro-benchmarking methods for these devices; quantifying the performance of each device for the varying hardware architectures. Micro-benchmarking was performed using lmbench - a cross platform benchmarking framework for UNIX devices. The macro-benchmarking was implemented using a custom developed CoAP benchmarking utility created using the libCoAP library. The results showed that the selection of the platform processor is a key design requirement and has the most potential to optimise CoAP server performance. The latency associated with the communication channels was found to be a dominating factor for round-trip times associated with CoAP requests.},

abstract={Manufacturers announce on a regular basis the availability of novel tiny devices, most of them featuring network interfaces: the Internet of Things (IoT) is already here - from the hardware perspective. On the software side however, embedded platforms available so far made it uneasy for developers to build apps that run across heterogeneous IoT hardware. Linux does not scale down to small, energy-constrained devices, while alternatives such as Contiki yield a steep learning curve and lengthy development life-cycles because they rule out standard programming and debugging tools. RIOT is a new open source software platform bridging this gap. RIOT allows just about any programmer to develop IoT application with zero learning curve. This is achieved by allowing standard C and C++ application programming with multi-threading, using well-known debugging tools (gdb, Valgrind, profilers etc.), while requiring only a minimum of 1.5 kB of RAM. RIOT also provides built-in energy efficiency and real-time capabilities. These characteristics make this platform attractive in several contexts, including teaching in the field of the Internet of Things, and experimental research in the domain of sensor networks and the IoT.},

Thus, middleware scalability is a key requirement for supporting the current growth of IoT. In this context, this article firstly presents ‘_IB - Micro Internet of Things Benchmark - that aims at evaluating the scalability of EPC-compliant middlewares. ‘_IB combines data from tags, RFID readers, sequential requests and number of threads to compose an evaluation setup to assess EPCIS and ALE components.

Applications built around this concept are constantly growing in variety and quantity. Technologies in IoT have been evolving rapidly and the alternatives also have increased quickly. As a result, it becomes challenging to conduct system and software trade-off analysis or select suitable IoT technologies for applications. The paper emphasizes variability management (consisting of alternative technologies) and aims to provide a framework as a result, which would allow or facilitate users to create their own IoT applications. In order to achieve this goal, we have adopted the idea of software product line engineering (SPLE) and created a framework with a layered architecture consisting of a Cloud Layer, a Central Hub Layer, and an End Devices Layer. The layers are loosely coupled with well-defined interfaces allowing for variability to be added at each layer. We were successfully able to create a framework which allows users to build their own applications, only being limited by the devices supported by the framework.},

abstract={This paper introduces a semipassive, reconfigurable UHF RF identification (RFID) sensing tag operating as the generic sensing platform (GSP) and the sensing nodes of the future Internet of Things (IoT). For generic real-time data acquisition, this new platform offers multiple inexpensive, plug-and-play sensing channels for the appended physical sensors. This new tag can be dynamically reconfigured to operate as a continuous data transmitting/receiving platform (online mode) or a data logging device (offline mode). In the offline mode, for accommodating and managing the high volume of data acquired by the tag sensors, a novel memory management scheme is designed and implemented. Furthermore, the platform employs an innovative data communication strategy that is compatible with the current electronic product code (EPC) Gen-2 communications protocols to facilitate the sensing data communications and other information exchange between the sensing node and the routing tier of IoT. Finally, the designed tag has been successfully deployed and tested in an experimental IoT setup for its performance evaluation as a GSP.},

abstract={The Future Internet concept has received a great deal of attention in recent years. The topic has been approached by a variety of perspectives, and certainly standardization is still to be agreed upon regarding some of the new terms and concepts that have gained currency in this period. One widely discussed direction involves the expansion of the Internet's model to include different forms of communications that may support connection to ""things"", i.e. all sorts of resources with some form of connectivity, that can connect to the Internet. These are not necessarily the resources that have traditionally been associated with computing, such as hosts, servers, routers, and so on. Rather, these can be any type of appliance with some minimal computational capability. This scenario proposes a much more richly connected world, in which connectivity to all sorts of things has suggested the expression ""Internet of Things"". Given the variety of functionality permitted to the networked resources, many mechanisms need to be investigated to suit different resource functionalities. As video data now accounts for over 50% of the Internet traffic, what are the considerations for video transmission, in real time, when the Internet of Things are incorporated? In this paper, we discuss some salient aspects, and consider specific recommendations for encoding based on the widely adopted ITU-T H264 standard. More specifically, we indicate how the high error rate associated with wireless communications channels, combined with the low computational capability of some of the networked resources, dictates different requirements and solutions for achieving acceptable quality of experience by the users.},

abstract={Due to the strong attacking ability, fast speed, simple implementation and other characteristics, differential fault analysis has become an important method to evaluate the security of cryptosystem in the Internet of Things. As one of the AES finalists, the Serpent is a 128-bit Substitution-Permutation Network (SPN) cryptosystem. It has 32 rounds with the variable key length between 0 and 256 bits, which is fexible to provide security in the Internet of Things. On the basis of the byte-oriented model and the differential analysis, we propose an effective differential fault attack on the Serpent cryptosystem. Mathematical analysis and simulating experiment show that the attack could recover its secret key by introducing 48 faulty ciphertexts. The result in this study describes that the Serpent is vulnerable to differential fault analysis in detail. It will be benefcial to the analysis of the same type of other iterated cryptosystems.},

We take as a starting point an approach proposed for team recommendation that aims at maximize the overall team reputation, based on the feedback that each team member receives from other members. It is important to point out that several important differences among the approaches exist - which we highlight in the paper - that do not allow for a mere adaptation from the team recommendation setting.},

The need is due to increased ICT use and the potentials for positive treatment outcomes from informed decision-making. A challenge is security of sensitive data, however detailing this is beyond the scope of this paper. In line with this need, an evolving cloud-based collaboration infrastructure resource is reported where global networks of professional subscribers will have increasing access to specific profile data and recommendation strategies. The focus on this phase of the work is to network those using (or considering using) ICT in wellness/QOL, rehabilitation and habilitation. The resource is being built from real-world case studies and is envisioned as a developing äóìfeed-in feed-outäó entity where evidence-based findings are submitted and extracted via a secured `gateway' by expert professional practitioners. The resource is considered an `Internet of Things' model to also inform and consult families of people diagnosed with impairments or patients undergoing treatment. Recommended intervention apparatus include bespoke/custom systems as well as commercially available systems. `In-action' and `On-action' models for have emerged from the research. This means that therapists adopting ICT into their work have a wealth of prior studies to guide their choices of hardware, software and intervention method and analysis without having to wade through academic or scientific articles, papers and book chapters.

This new stage of the industrial revolution will pose a challenge to all businesses and industrial organisations, requiring them to organise themselves and their production in a totally new way in networks around the world. New types of organising and organisations need to be developed and implemented. Not only can such new forms no longer be focused on direct control over the execution or checking of available information, they must actually be aimed at the self-steering and self-organisation of small and autonomous organisational components within the network.

Buildings as important parts of the smart grids, their energy efficiency is vital for the environment and global sustainability. Using a LEED-gold-certificated green office building, we built a unique IoT experimental testbed for our energy efficiency and building intelligence research. We first monitor and collect one-year-long building energy usage data and then systematically evaluate and analyze them. The results show that due to the centralized and static building controls, the actual running of green buildings may not be energy efficient even though they may be ""green"" by design. Inspired by ""energy proportional computing"" in modern computers, we propose a IoT framework with smart location-based automated and networked energy control, which uses smartphone platform and cloud computing technologies to enable multi-scale energy proportionality including building-, user-, and organizational-level energy proportionality. We further build a proof-of-concept IoT network and control system prototype and carried out real-world experiments which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution. We envision that the broad application of the proposed solution has not only led to significant economic benefits in term of energy saving, improving home/office network intelligence, but also bought in a huge social implication in terms of global sustainability.},

abstract={With frequent food safety incidents, it becomes urgent and important to design an intuitively quantitative trust model to describe the trustworthiness of foods delivered in supply chains. However, current existing models are usually too subjective, because they heavily depend on experts' experiences to model the trust and set relevant parameters. Fortunately, the Internet of Agricultural Things may offer a big volume of business data, including product information and delivery information etc., via its pervasive sensing. These data motivate us to design a data driven quantitative model to evaluate the trust of sensed products in supply chains. The proposed trust model leverages a Bayesian network, where almost all parameters are set by the data rather than experts' experiences, to evaluate the trust value of a target product. Finally, a case of pork product is used to show the effectiveness of our trust model. Based on the comparison with other models, our model is promising to reduce the subjectivity and time-delay of the trust evaluation.},

abstract={Electronic Product Code Information System (EPCIS) has been a well-known information system for tracking and monitoring physical objects' life-cycle using RFID technology. However, in the Internet of Things (IoT) context, physical objects are supposed to be equipped with computing and sensing capability. Thus, people are interested not only in objects' life-cycle but also their contextual data. This emerging issue poses a new functional requirement on the traditional EPCIS such that, objects' contextual data should also be managed along with their life-cycle. Meanwhile, one of the most important IoT application lays in Building Automation Systems where smart devices are connected and automated without human intervention. These devices usually generate a large volume of data in a daily basis and thus, designing a proper data warehousing for this use case becomes a challenge. This paper aims at adding a data capturing interface to the traditional EPCIS so that it can support objects' data storage and retrieval, thus seamlessly adds significant support for Building Automation Systems application. The extended system, which is called Smart Thing Information System (STIS), exploits the oBIX standard and CoAP protocol to capture the data send from the smart devices and provides an additional lightweight query interface also based on CoAP. The system's applicability has been verified through a practical global-wide test bed between Korea and Austria.},

However, as IoT devices have resource constraints to employ powerful security mechanisms, they are vulnerable to sophisticated security attacks such as the main-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. Therefore, an intelligent authentication mechanism that considers both resource constraints and security is required. In this paper, we suggest a dynamic and energy-aware authentication scheme for the Internet of Things (DAoT). DAoT uses a feedback control scheme to dynamically select an energy-efficient authentication policy. With DAoT, IoT devices with limited resources can be safely interconnected because DAoT finds and adopts the best cost-effective authentication mechanism.},

Lightweight authentication protocols for resource {constrained smart devices should be secure against äóìphysical attacksäó such as Side-Channel Attack. Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs) are a class of novel hardware security primitives that promise a paradigm shift in many security applications and protocols. In essence, a PUF circuit is a partially disordered system that has an instance{speci_c input{output behavior that cannot be replicated by manufacturing (hence physically unclonable""). The unique features of PUFs avoid explicit key storage, and thus make them immune against many of the existing physical attacks which aim to divulge the secret key of cryptographic algorithms. However, the concept of PUF is not a panacea in the domain of security, and they are still vulnerable to several forms of intelligent attacks, using a combination of concepts borrowed from side-channel analysis and machine learning. In this tutorial, we would explore design challenges, operating principles, attacks and defence strategies for PUF circuits. The tutorial would cover the following topics: Fundamentals of PUF, Lightweight PUF Designs, Security Analysis of PUFs and PUF-based Authentication Protocols.},

The trial has been executed in one of the parks of the city of Santander providing an autonomous public street lighting adaptation service. The trial takes advantage of both the critical communications infrastructures already in place and owned by the utility as well as of the Internet of Things infrastructure belonging to the city municipality to accelerate efficient provision of existing and new city services. The main contribution presented in the paper is, indeed, the assessment of the energy savings achieved during the field trials and the study of key performance indicators analyzed during the trial. The paper highlights how FI technologies create the necessary glue and logic that allows the integration of current vertical and isolated city services into a holistic solution, which enables a huge forward leap for the efficiency and sustainability of our cities.

abstract={Implementing a monolithic highly efficient ultralow photovoltaic (PV) power harvesting system is pivotal for smart nodes of Internet of things (IOT) networks. This paper proposes a fully integrated harvesting system in 0.18-‘_m CMOS technology. Utilizing a small commercial solar cell of 2.5 cmŒ_, the proposed system can provide 0-29 ‘_W of power, which is much higher than the commonly used passive radio-frequency identification devices in IOT application. The hill-climbing maximum power point tracking algorithm is developed in an energy-efficient manner to tune the input impedance of the system and guarantee adaptive maximum power transfer under wide illumination conditions. The detailed impedance tuning approach is implemented with a capacitor value modulation to eliminate the quiescent power consumption as well as to achieve a higher efficiency than the traditional pulse-frequency modulation scheme. A supercapacitor is utilized for buffering, energy storing, and filtering purposes, which enables more functions of the IOT smart nodes such as active sensing and system-on-chip (SOC) signal processing. The output voltage ranges between 3.0 and 3.5 V for different device loads, such as sensors, SOC, or wireless transceivers. The measured results confirm that this PV harvesting system achieves both ultralow operation capability under 20 ‘_W and a self-sustaining efficiency of 89%.},

A service providing model is built to find the relationship between bandwidth and energy consumption using a cooperative differential game model. The game solution is gotten in the condition of grand coalition, feedback Nash equilibrium and intermediate coalitions and an allocation policy is obtain by Shapley theory. The results are shown as follows. Firstly, the performance of IoT decreases with the increasing of bandwidth cost or with the decreasing of energy cost; secondly, all the nodes in the IoT composing a grand coalition can save bandwidth and energy consumption; thirdly, when the factors of bandwidth cost and energy cost are equal, the obtained number of provided services is an optimised value which is the trade-off between energy and bandwidth consumption.},
